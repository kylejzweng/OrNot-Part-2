1,Joe,28 Jun 2023,United States,5,Go to jersey for spring and fall riding,"This is my go to jersey for rides in the spring or fall in the Bay Area. Decent enough warmth that I don't suffer in the cold before I warm up but also breathable enough that I'm not dying when I finally have warmed up and the sun has come out.

Really good fit with clean lines and nice details. Pockets hold lots of gear without being baggy.",3,Men's Lightweight Long Sleeve Jersey - Blue Line,,"5'9"" 150 lbs"
2,Tony,28 Jun 2023,United Kingdom,5,Perfect for spring and fall,I bought this in 2021 and it still looks as good now as the day it arrived. I’ve worn it at least a hundred times and it’s perfect for rides between 50 and 65F. With a gilet it can even be worn down to 45. I am between sizes and decided to go with a large. I think either size would have been fine as the material is so stretchy.,4,Men's Lightweight Long Sleeve Jersey - Blue Line,,"6 foot 1 inch, 170 pounds"

9,J. Quinn,27 Jun 2023,United States,5,LS lightweight house jersey - Coastal Orange,"I live in north Florida, and the sun is no joke. I was looking for something with long sleeves and a UPF rating, and that's what led me to this jersey (and, really, to Ornot).

I loved this from the first time I put it on, and I still love it now, more than two years along. If the sun was out, and it was warmer than ~60° F, then this is what I was wearing on the bike (sometimes with a base layer underneath). In the 30s F, then this underneath a Magic Shell works great for me.

If I could have the arms just a bit longer - perhaps 1"" - I would. I understand, though, that that's getting into the realm of not practically being able to fit every body perfectly; my arms are just a little bit on the long side.

Aside from the excellent functionality, I love the low-key aesthetic. The Coastal Orange is a great color, with a subtle pattern that gives it a little bit of visual texture, compared to a solid color.",3,Men's Lightweight Long Sleeve Jersey – Plum Line,,"5' 10"", 148 lb"
10,Andrew W.,27 Jun 2023,United States,4,"Like the Product, But the sizing...","Really like this jersey, but not quite as enamored with the sizing. According to the online sizing guidance, I should be wearing a large (5'10"", 175 lbs) but had to exchange for an XL, and might try an XXL next time. I feel like the guidelines should mention garmets are a tight fit!

11,Jason,27 Jun 2023,United States,4,Stretchy and lightweight,"This is awesome for summer time riding when you want UV protection for your arms or for 50-60 degree weather with a baselayer and vest. It is great for early morning starts in the summer too when brushed back arm warmers are too warm. 

Don’t over stuff the pockets however as I’ve already torn the top of the pocket after less than a year of weekly rides. If it weren’t for that I’d give it five stars.",3,Men's Lightweight Long Sleeve Jersey - Blue Line,,5’ 11” and 175 lbs

However, brought this on a trip to California and rode in the high desert. The low humidity meant I was able to ride this well into triple digit temperatures (I saw 105 on my bike computer at one point) without feeling uncomfortable.

Note on size, I normally wear an XS in Assos, Rapha, La Passione for tops, but this in small fit pretty well. It's not as tight as what I'd prefer, but I needed a small to be able to get my hands through the sleeves.",3,LS Lightweight House Jersey - Coastal Lead,Small,"5'7"", 150-160 pounds"

135,warren b.,11 Nov 2021,United States,5,LS Lightweight House Jersey,I previously purchased the coyote thermal version in a small last year. A little snug for my liking due to some winter weight gain but the stretch was great. I ended up sizing up in this jersey and I like the fit a little better. It's still form fitting and slightly long on the arms. It doesn't bother me since the arms are snug and don't flap in the wind.

Cool enough to block the sun on a sunny summer ride in the high altitude UV where I live. Fit is pretty much bang on compared to the SS jerseys, although the forearms are a tad snug (even on my chicken arms). Bonus points for Ornot making LS jerseys with sleeves that accommodate tall, lanky folks with mega ape indexes like me. Overall an excellent addition to my cycling wardrobe.

It was a warmer day than expected so spent most of the day in the 60s-70s with this and a HH Dry baselayer or Assos summer weight skin foil. Really comfortable, very light and breathable, will be really useful for winter riding here in the southeast. I normally wear an XS in Rapha, Assos, La Passione, but got a small in this so my hands can fit through the long sleeves and it wouldn't be too tight on my forearms.

As some others have pointed out, it's kind of hard to pull the sleeves on, but it's well worth the trade off of avoiding the need for sun screen on the arms. The fit is just perfect, not too long or short. The pockets are sized just right; I can easily reach into the middle pocket with my old-not-too-flexible shoulders.

189,John,26 Jul 2021,United States,5,My favorite piece of kit,"This is one of my favorite if not my favorite piece of cycling gear. I looked every where for a non thermal long sleeve jersey. I wanted a jersey that was long sleeve but light enough to wear on cool to warm days. I also wanted something that acted almost like a rash guard so that I did not have to keep applying sun screen all day. I had almost given up when I stumbled Ornot. This jersey is perfect for those days when the temp starts in the mid 60s and moves up to the 80s. It is extremely breathable but if you are looking for something that blocks the wind this is not it. On a scale of 1-10, it is 1.5-2 for wind blocking. I also love the subtle style and top quality of ornot. It is by far the best cycling gear out there. Lastly the sizing chart is amazing.

I think it's perfect for cooler mornings/evenings up to nice sunny days.

For all-day rides it's great to have extra coverage, and mixing various base layers and/or a vest makes this super versatile.

I'm 6', 160lbs with a 38"" chest and 30"" waist. I bought a small (The small feels more like a race-fit, and when I'm riding I don't notice the jersey at all... which is exactly what I like).

Great for protecting your arms from sunburn on days that are not ridiculously hot, but with a warmer base layer (merino!) or a wind vest, I've been comfortable down to 55*F. Coastal Fog color is a really pleasant light pastel blue that helps you stand out on the road without violating everyone's eyes with day-glo yellow.

Keep in mind that this is a pretty slim-cut garment, meant to be worn in tandem with bib shorts. Taller folks who don't wear bibs will be at risk of having their navel poking out, the jersey is not cut that long in the front (but consequently doesn't bunch up in the stomach region).",3,LS Lightweight House Jersey - Coastal Lead,Medium,"6'1"" (185cm), 170lbs (77kg)"

306,Ryan H.,07 Apr 2021,United States,5,This is the one,"I now have two sizes of these as well as a short-sleeve House, key lessons are tighter is better and Gravel is indeed actually gray. I'm a slim lanky build, for me the Medium is feels almost too snug at first, but it's very stretchy and once I get moving can appreciate the slippery sleekness that is not a loose jersey flapping around. Out on the road, it's perfect where a Large ends up loose and bunchy.

The Gravel color is a very-slightly-cool/neutral gray as opposed to the Coastal Lead version which is pretty much baby-blue. This one is the one you want if you like the photos of Coastal Lead and hope you're getting a silvery-gray jersey. 

Very light-weight, works on its own in temps from the 60's up into the 80's, of course can layer down into cooler temps as well (get that Merino base layer, it's magic). Comfortable and fast.",3,LS Lightweight House Jersey - Gravel,Medium,"6' 1"" 175lb"

I also order three different colors of this jersey after trying on the first one. It is perfect for cool riding (high 50's to mi-70's) but I also appreciate it in warmer weather because I am no longer striving for that cycling tan line lol. I find even more value in wearing this with a base layer under a thin (or thick) jacket for cold weather riding because it feels so comfortable and acts as a conduit between my skin and the jacket.

It's a nice tight fit but stretchy where it needs to be. I feel pretty aero and not look like a sausage casing. I have longer arms and torso - the arms fit great - it is racier fit cut for bike so the belly portion arches up quite high - not an issue in bib shorts. 
Pockets feel secure. Stitching is strong - it has a nice amount of stretch for how thin it feels. The black version has nice subtle blue details.
Would have loved a zip pocket even if it added a few more bucks. 
Breathes extremely well - I wore it over Craft LS active extreme baselayer and under a wind vest and it was good in 45 to 55 degrees. With a heavier baselayer I could see that going down into lower 40s. It will also be great under my windjacket or a winter softshell when its below freezing.

478,D. Arnott,15 Jun 2020,United States,5,"Great Jersey -- Buy it, Ornot","Overall, I recommend this piece of kit. It would be a nice addition to any collection. I, for one, am glad to have it even though I did not really need it as my cycling wardrobe is already tightly curated. However, I was intrigued by the claim that, depending on the base layer, it could satisfy any ride between 40-80 degrees. And while I have not tested it at the low end of 40, I do believe the claim is true. I tested four different base layers (a Giordana sleeveless, an Assos Spring/Fall short sleeve, a Rapha ProTeam lightweight short sleeve, an Assos summer long sleeve) and I am sure my Assos long sleeve Spring/Fall base layer would work with this jersey for a 40 degree ride. The main thing is to dial it in. 

Originally, I thought I would provide a review of each base layer tested under different riding conditions, but I realize that I run a bit cold and my preference is to dress up (I would rather be too warm than too cold) and that what works for me won’t necessarily work for everyone. Body temperature and comfort may just be as specific as a finger print. In any case, here are a few considerations:

The jersey does not wick away sweat well and therefore acts like a sort of air-conditioner. Basically, without a base layer to remove sweat away from your skin, the jersey lets in air without letting out moister and the result is a cooling effect. This is a good thing and a bad thing, depending. On a hot day, it makes for a nice warm breeze if you can keep your speed up. In fact, this quality is a sort of motivator as you got to keep moving to keep cool. One thing is for sure, I would think twice about using the jersey, with or without a base layer, on a 80 degree day where I would be slogging up some exposed mountain for any length of time. On cooler days or even warm days with that Bay Area wind, the right base layer is essential. If fact, one day I went out in the Rapha Proteam lightweight short sleeve base layer and was fine until I hit Samual P. Taylor. The temperature drops there as it always does and there was a bit of a headwind. For that little stretch it felt like my arms were colder than if they had been bare (my core was fine though). I was glad to reach the coast and even happier to be heading up Bofax. 

The only other consideration is that you got to be careful not to dress up - you don’t want to be in the middle of a ride with the temperature increasing and wishing you could shed a layer with your only options being to strip your jersey or your base layer. Got to check your variable conditions before you suit up. This is not to say that the jersey does not work under viable conditions: I did a ride up to Tam (Assos Summer long sleeve jersey) on one of those days when heading out of the city where I live was in the mid-50s, then heavy with fog and wet all the way up Panoramic until past Pantoll the sun is out and it is 82 degrees heading up to East Peak - I was fine and happy on the descents). 

In short, my recommendation: Buy it and then dial it.",3,LS Lightweight House Jersey - Black - XS Only,Medium,6 Feet/ 175lbs

Nice trim cut with no flappin’ in the wind. Light as can be. I’m a fan. I’m probably a M if I am really fit and lean but at 56 and maybe 5-8 lbs heavy L was just right. Nice to be able to size up and not feel like you bought the wrong size. The stretch in the material gives it a broad range of fit.

A few unsolicited opinions:
1. Sleeves are a bit long for me which cause some minor wrinkles and rolls to form.
2. The extra ""collar"". Not sure why this is needed. It would feel so much better, especially in higher temperatures to remove the extra band of fabric around the collar. In colder temperatures, I can simply layer up.
3. Need to add a small zippered pocket for essentials like cash, cards, and keys. I don't necessarily want to carry my wallet with me on every ride. This is pretty standard on most mid to high end apparel but is missing here.

Maybe because I have a long torso, but it seems just a bit short compared to other jerseys. I do like that it’s shorter in the front, but the back could be a bit longer to help avoid ‘the gap’. Also the torso is quite snug, and the arms are slightly loose.

780,Jay C.,23 Jul 2022,United States,5,Fantastic looking and feeling,"The jersey is a nice looking one and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. Sizing feels accurate; I consider myself in between a medium and a large in tops being that I am 5’ 8.5” and around 170 pounds and my chest is 40.5” around and torso are more on the wide and round side. The medium I ordered is comfortable but I feel right on the cusp of a large. The only area that gets a little tight is if I keep the jersey zipped all the way up, I usually leave it about 1/4” unzipped so it doesn’t feel like it is pushing on my trachea. I don’t get any zipper bunching while in my riding positions. Like I said though, my measurements put me right on the upper limit of the medium. I could see ordering a large to see the difference. Ornot staff are very helpful, so before you order email them with your measurements and they can help.",3,House Jersey - Fog,Medium,"5’ 8.5”, 170 pounds"

I had a chance to try one out this past weekend for an 80 mile ride. Was 80F and humid, but stayed relatively cool due to the light weight and wicking qualities.

Know that it is a shallower pocket than some other jerseys, but it should still have enough room to fit anything you need. And if not, get a bar bag. Oh, and know that, as others have said, it's definitely tight. I'm 5'11'' and 170-175 depending on the season and I went with a medium. I do think it's ultimately the right size given the actual length of the jersey, but nothing is left to the imagination. Though again, I haven't worn it on a ride yet.

843,Jason d.,05 Nov 2021,Australia,4,Nearly amazing....,"This is a great jersey. The design, colour, fit and fabric are all great. I particularly like the cool feel of the fabric and have enjoyed using the jersey in hotter weather. 

It is a snug fit so keeps me honest with my diet (not a bad thing).

The only issue I have is the depth of the pockets. As an example, my phone doesn't sit completely inside the pocket and about 15% of it pokes out the top. As a result I worry about it falling out quite a lot when I'm riding. 

I wear an XS so I am familiar with having smaller pockets. I appreciate that if they're a bit higher they're harder to get into however I'd much rather than scenario than have to worry about the content of the pockets all the time when I ride.

971,David,02 Jun 2021,United States,5,Fantastic!,"6'3"" male, 168lb, 36"" inseam, arms as long, 40"" chest, 32"" waist

The House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length). It fits closely but not tightly on me and has very little ""zipper bunch"" when on the bike in the drops or hoods. It might be a tad bit better with a fourth zippered pocket for valuables but not necessary and I knew this when I asked for it, among other Ornot items, for my birthday

BTW:
- the Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color let down somewhat by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (this may be due to my height and needing a Medium but no other bib I have is as difficult )) 
Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are just better but don't have that color!",3,House Jersey - Sage,Large,"6'3"" 168lbs"

1017,KTS,09 Apr 2021,United States,5,"Snug, lightweight, comfortable. A few minor gripes.","So far so good with the House Jersey! This is a great summer-weight jersey, and the colors along with subtle texture and design cues really help it stand out from a lot of other jerseys, without relying on neon logos or ostentatious patterns. Front of the jersey is a tighter-weave material than the perforated side and back panels, so the jersey does a great job of shedding heat.

Fit is tight - this is more of a race-cut jersey. Don't expect to wear it with out bibs, otherwise your navel might be hanging out. That being said, you don't have to size up like many European brands.

Functionally, my only complaints are that it would be nice to have one small zippered pocket, and at this price point it would be nice to see laser-cut seams on the sleeves with silicone grippers, as opposed to the rolled-and-sewn construction. But I can't knock a high-quality jersey sewn in the USA, and given the available colors and the overall quality, I'll likely be saving up my beans to purchase another one soon.",3,House Jersey - Coastal Burgundy,Medium,"6'1"" (185cm), 170lbs (78kg)"

1159,Justin S.,25 Aug 2020,United States,5,Excellent summer jersey,"I love this jersey so far. The Ornot customer service folks gave me great advice on sizing - I was right on the cusp but decided to go with the large. Ordinarily I wear size small in shirts, but the cut of the House Jersey is really slim-fit/athletic, so if you're debating, I'd size up.

The fabric is super soft and moisture-wicking - perfect for warm weather rides. Also, the Fog colorway is sweet.I tried the Work jersey as well but like fabric of the House jersey better.

My only complaint is I could go for a slightly longer front zipper.

1194,Ryan H.,12 Aug 2020,United States,5,"It's okay to pick favorites, Ornot.","I’m between sizes on the House jerseys, so it's horses for courses: Large fits slightly loose, very comfy and more generous for moving around but gathers up a bit. M is aero-race-fit snug and lays down smooth, good for those purposeful focussed fast days after I've done my push-ups and crunches. It adds at least another 20 watts on the road, Ornot. Like the fantastic bibs, the House jersey materials are super-stretchy and soft, basically disappears once you get moving.

The Morocco color is perfection; not yellow, or mustard, or that safety-neon-green, but somehow all of them together. Looks fantastic tied with the Stone Blue vest and Coastal Bolt Storm sock.

My one gripe is the lack of zipper key pocket, something I didn't even realize I had become so accustom to till I found it missing. But I suppose that is the tradeoff for a good price on something made in USA.

Of course I have used a lot of ill-fitting jerseys over the years, mostly REI stuff and whatever I get from organized group rides. But this just feels perfect and the blue is absolutely lovely. 

I've used this jersey once after hand washing. I hope it holds up. I don't want to say ""it feels like wearing nothing at all"" because it does and it doesn't. You just don't notice it, it's not pushing and pulling in the wrong places, the zipper doesn't ride up, the neckline doesn't ride up, the selves are just right when on the bike. But at the same time it does provide some support and plenty of wicking.

I have other Ornot jerseys and like the range of colors. I ordered a XL 88kg and 5'10') and the it fits well. This is a race fit jersey, though I am not 'race fit' I like the fit and look.

Haven’t come across a jersey made for my body type yet and will admit it is frustrating. I always upsize jerseys but the largest available was an L. I read somewhere I should try out a mens product so I ordered an M based on the sizing chart. I thought it would be roomier but ended up looking and feeling like an overstuffed sausage in it. Regardless, the quality was really high, love the color and the feel of the material. The sleeve length was perfect. Perforation on the back and sides awesome. Providing I could find the perfect fit, I know I would have been very comfortable in it. I also have to mention how amazing your customer service is, the email communication transparent like no other. I love supporting small companies with the right values! I will buy again... once I shed some pounds off! Or maybe you could expand your clothing to an XL for women like me on the fluffier side.",1,House Jersey - Coastal Burgundy,Medium,5’7 and 180 lbs

1257,Andy K.,09 Jul 2020,United States,4,"If you're between a Medium and Large, read this!","I'm 6'1"", 175lbs. Average length torso, wide shoulders and 32"" waist. Fit build, but not like the models on this site. I first tried the medium as everybody else in the comments who matched my body type said that was the right size. It definitely fit my arms/shoulders (which are broad) but it was just a little too high on my waist. It didn't show my belly, but it just looked like it shrunk in the front. (my wife immediately noticed and thought it looked funny) I ordered the Large and it's about an inch or two longer and fits great. It's still snug on my arms, chest, and stomach, but has the length I was looking for. The House Jersey is tight no matter what size you buy, so neither the M or the L were saggy or loose for me. If anything, the M was like sausage-casing racing tightness, the L was a comfortable tightness, surprisingly with no bunching or extra wrinkles. I went through the same process with the bibs but ended up keeping the Mediums. I could have worn either, but I have skinnier legs and butt so the M bib was a better fit.",3,House Jersey - Coastal Burgundy,Large,"6'1"", 175 lbs"

Ive never felt so comfortable in a jersey as much as this. Its like I'm wearing nothing at all! 30 miles so far with lots of dirt, water and heat. It was extra ventilated and kept me cool at times I wanted to quit. It does get dirty easy, reaching into my back pockets with dirty hands and splashing through creek crossing but once you get home take it off and just hand wash it and the spots all come off easily. If you leave it in a pile in the garage then maybe the stains will be more permanent but just wash it and you're good. Will be buying many other jerseys in the future.

I bought this color because it is not as hot in the sun and I think it just looks good overall. I have stained it slightly by doing some maintenance on my bike before/during/after riding and then accidentally rubbing greasy hands on it. That is not a fault of the product but of me.

I own A LOT of kit; Pedla, Pas Normal, Hunter Bros, Attaquer, Pedal Mafia, Rapha, ENDO Customs, SAS and more...no, seriously, even more - Finch, La Passione, Isadore, God&Famous, Ostroy, MONO, Morvelo...and more. I can honestly say (and this is field tested, multi-brand Owner talking here) ORNOT'S FIT AND FINISH IS UNPARALLELED. IT IS PERFECT, IT IS UNMATCHED AND THE PRICING IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BRAND. And the low key graphics - once considered an alternative to the endlessly ""loud"" offerings which exists, has become the new industry pursuit and now other Brands are chasing ORNOT's minimalist aesthetic which they simply cannot do. Sure, PNS has some cool, low volume graphics based on Skando-design elements BUT THAT AINT NEW and frankly at almost $300 for a F*** PNS Jersey for instance is absolutely ******!

Fit is the same for as many other brands. Maybe slightly tighter than Craft, Louis G but not quite Castelli tight (which causes me to size up). Probably most similar Velocio sizing.

The Ornot brand was exactly what I was looking for. I love all of their designs, couldn't decide which to choose first. I went with the coastal orange jersey with no regret. At 6ft 165 lbs, the medium fits like a glove. The material is the softest of any jersey I have ever owned. The waist band fits snug so that when the pockets are filled everything stays in place and don't flop around when riding over bumps. The first day I wore it I received several compliments on the jersey. I'm definitely a brand fan for life. You'll have to try it for yourself....ornot",3,House Jersey - Coastal Orange,,6ft 165 lbs

1590,Ken C.,05 Apr 2019,United States,5,Silky smooth in Spring,"Great jersey, incredibly comfortable. At first I thought it was a little too lightweight, but the material is smooth as butter. I ain't mad. It actually made me realize how much more mid-weight & textured my other jerseys are.

FYI: The Navy Line, isn't actually white. It has a slight blue hue; threw me off at first, but I kinda like it

TIP/SUGGESTION: The fabric is so fine & soft, it can actually get caught in the zipper slightly. I didn't experience it when sipping up while wearing the jersey, since the fabric was stretched. But when zipping up before laundering, it was pretty difficult because the fabric kept getting caught.

Only this time I will get him a gift card. You have some bike shorts I think he would love but do not know what size. That's why the gift card.

Only downside is it's not the most flattering cut (at least for me). Gives off more of an athleisure / dad *** vibe than I thought it would, which prevents it from being the off-bike staple I had hoped. Wish it were a little slimmer around the tummy and waist—there's a bit of excess fabric there.

It's very warm, soft feeling, comfy and the large size fits me surprisingly well on my 6' 4"" slim-muscular build. My shirt sleeves in a fitted shirt usually measure 35.5, so not the longest arms around, but not short. So far the inner material hasn't piled noticeably. Mud/rod grime stains seem to come off easily. 

I (enjoy the cold and) have worn it as a top layer under a vest down to the high 30s (dry) last fall on a social ride. With a wool base layer, it held heat well in that setting. Otherwise, I wear it on and off the bikes. It gets lots of compliments around town for the great golden yellow color and smart fit.

This is my first piece from ornot, but I suspect it won't be my last. It's incredibly warm, so much so that I haven't had a chance to wear it on a ride yet but I did golf in it and it was excellent. It's also super stretchy. I'm 6'3""and 200lbs with long arms and the large fits me perfectly, though a little snug now after one wash (more on that in a minute). I would say if you are between sizes go up. Love that it's made in the USA from dead stock fabric. And generally love the look and design, very understated and cool.

1810,Lee M.,25 Oct 2022,United States,4,Perfect design; nicely crafted; guirky fabric,"I absolutely love the way this pullover fits. It’s halfway between a sweater and a sweatshirt because the fabric is cozy with a fleece interior while the fit and appearance is more like a nice wool sweater. It is extremely warm and seems to be windproof to some extent such that on a day in the high 60’s it is a little too warm to keep on while riding. I anticipate wearing it often once the weather dips down into the 50’s. 
The one issue I’ve had was after washing it the first time with mild detergent in cold water the sweater came out of the washer smelling somewhat like burnt plastic or rubber. Nothing else in the load had the same smell and the smell went away after letting it hang dry but it was a bit off-putting.

One of the problems I often have with sweaters is Large fits me *ok* but I find myself wishing they were just a little longer.

It is more of a form fitting long sleeve shirt with a hood than a pull over hoodie if you order your actual size. But I like it like this.

1936,Michael M.,04 Feb 2022,United States,5,Favorite new casual cold weather gear,"I typically don't like to wear hoodies because all of mine are sweatshirts which are okay but where I live, it's not typically cold enough to use them as a layer beneath a jacket or vest. But this piece solves the problem because it's so thin and layers easily. Being as thin as it is, it's plenty warm when it needs to be. I found the sizing to be perfect. I'm 155-160 lbs and just under 6' and the medium fits well. I also wear medium Ornot jerseys but the hooded pullover is not skin tight like those.

1946,Michael B.,08 Jan 2022,United States,5,Ultra Versatile,"The cut and design details of this Hoody make it a super versatile piece and I'm really glad I got one. Some reviews state the sizing runs small, I'd say that sort of depends on how you plan on using it. For myself, I'm 5'10"" (long torso), 37"" Chest, 30"" waist and 148lbs. I'm actually somewhere in between a Small and XS in Ornot jerseys. The size chart put me square in a Small, but I ordered a Small and an XS just to be sure. The XS fit, but it was quite snug with a long sleeve tee under, but could have worked if I was going to use it solely as a riding layer only. However, I think versatility was in mind in the design of this piece, so I went with a Small. Its perfectly comfy with a t-shirt for lounging and running errands, makes a great mid layer under a denim jacket, and as I found today, still makes a great riding layer. 

The cut is on the slimmer side and I think maybe its a touch shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create a huge pouch when on the bike. This sort of works out really well, so I guess maybe go up a size if you are buying this strictly just for lounging. Otherwise, I'd say stick with the chart. 

Ride: Today I did a chill recovery ride in a pair of bibs, the sleeveless merino base layer, and this pullover. It was 57F, partly cloudy and I was perfectly cosy, but never overheated. The gridded material does a great job of insulating, while also breathing and allowing some fresh air to blow through. You could probably wear it doing intervals....ornot.

1984,Michael O.,30 Nov 2021,United States,5,Hooded pullover in slate,"Damn…you, Ornot! You hit it outta the park, again! When I first picked it up, I noticed how shear it seemed. But, it’s tougher than expected, the subjective shear appearance allows much breath ability, while the material gives warmth without being hot. Sure, it’s late November, but it could be coupled with a base layer or nothing and cross a wide range of temperatures. You could easily use it for hiking, trail running, casual daily use or as a mid weight base layer for snowboarding. Super versatile. I rode part trails and road with my mission shorts for a different vibe, but all the function. I’m 5’8” and 157 lbs., lean but wide shoulders. Some of my ornot tops are mediums, some large just to get my shoulders to fit. I ordered large. It’s neither too long in body or arms, and it’s still slim, which I like. Not skin tight, aero fit, but not flapping around at all. I know it’ll be a go-to keeper for rides and trail runs throughout the remainder of fall, winter and spring. Hope you release a different color, because I want another one. ",N/A,Hooded Pullover - Slate Gray,LARGE,N/A

1986,Justin,26 Nov 2021,United States,4,"Love the concept, but runs a small","I'm super excited to see Ornot expanding their product line. I love the idea of using deadstock fabric to make other products. The details of this hoodie illustrate the commitment and forethought of the folks at Ornot: wide hem on the cuffs and bottom, zippers on the kangaroo pocket, hidden back pocket, and an extremely light and breathable fabric. 

If you are familiar with Melanzana grid fleeces, the Ornot hoodie is much more breathable. The fabric isn't as soft as a Mele (maybe after washing?), but I think it is more versatile and useable across a range of temperatures. 

As much as I wanted to make this hoodie work, I can't. The sizing is too slim. I comfortably wear XL in Ornot's bike products (jerseys, bibs, jackets, trail shirts, and the merino sweater). I ordered a XXL in the hoodie and I can barely get it on. It would be fine to wear on a bike ride, but not as an everyday layer. I was under the impression that the fit was meant to be more casual, but maybe it has something to do with the fabric that is being used. I recommend this product, but I returned mine.

2017,JK,13 Oct 2022,United States,4,Warmer and Better Looking Than Expected,"The online photos make this jersey look like it's black with a bright orange zipper when in fact it's a dark charcoal grey with a burnt orange zipper, a combo that in my opinion looks much better in real life. What really surprised me though is how warm this jersey is. Most of the reviews and descriptions talk about its breathability and how cool it is but I wore it for the first time yesterday on a 70º F fall evening and it was verging on being uncomfortably warm. The fabric felt more like a thin sweater than a performance cycling jersey, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but just wasn't expected. Also, like many others have stated, the sleeves are oddly loose... I have a larger upper body build than your typical cyclist and even on me (5' 11"" 167lbs) in size medium, they weren't baggy but not snug like my other jerseys.

I was looking for more versatility so I could wear it while riding in a wide range of temperatures. I did my first ride with it yesterday and it was extremely hot and humid.

In the past, I’ve tried preserve me, Castelli, Hincapie, but Ornot House bibs seems to be a step above. The material is stretchy and soft. The phone grippers are significantly nicer than typical silicon lined clippers. The straps are comfortably loose. It doesn’t pull down on your shoulders like some other straps I’ve experienced.

Three hour rides outside and on the trainer with no issues. I am 5’11” 147 and bought the small. The fit is supportive not too tight. The chamois is on the thinner side which I prefer.

2274,Michael B.,03 Sep 2021,United States,5,Now a Favorite!,"I own and have owned a lot of different premium bib shorts and I think these strike the best balance of features and price. Great compression (though ordered a size down...more later), killer color (photos don't really do them justice), and most importantly a great pad/chamois. To me a good chamois is a make it or break it deal. These are definitely a make it. 

The Elastic Interface pad strikes a real Goldie Locks balance. Supportive, but not too thick (can't stand a thick chamois), and just the right density for a few hours of riding. I'm also not a big fan of super dense pads...they tend to make me feel numb after a while. So bravo Ornot on pad selection. 

Size: I'm sort of on the cusp of an XS and Small...leaning towards Small. I'm 5'10"" (all torso), 145lbs, 30"" waist, and have fairly lean climber-ish thighs. I prefer a racier cut/fit. I originally ordered a Small but felt like I might swimming around in the crotch a bit...no bueno. So after a little guidance from customer service, I got them swapped for an XS and am super happy with the fit. Hope that maybe helps someone else. 

Overall, I'd give these two thumbs up on price, fit and comfort. I grab these bibs more often than any of my others now.

Comfortable, chamois held up over ~6.5 hours. The silicone-free leg grippers are super comfortable and don't irritate my skin, which I find happens on longer rides when wearing bibs with silicone grippers.

 I now have 4 Ornot items (an older lightweight Long sleeve jersey, which is an inch too short for my very long arms,and a vest) and will have a fifth when the Stone Vest is again available in Large.

The Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color, good but not superb fit, let down just a tad by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. 
Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (may be due to my height and needing a Medium) Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are better

Also:
- the House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic fit, finish and look, with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length).",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Mesa,Large,N/A

Bought 4 of these a couple of years ago, and I conservatively estimate I put about 100 hours in each pair. Happy to report they're still in good shape -- not a single stich has come loose or undone, unlike a few Italian name brand bibs I've used. Initial feel was stiff, and while they're still holding their shape, they've softened up some. The fabric is showing no obvious signs of wear, though it might be thinning after so many uses and washes. About a year ago I noticed two of the bibs had a tiny amount of the chamois coming through the stitching; I was afraid it was the beginning of an unraveling, but it hasn't gotten worse and I've ignored it. I've worn knee warmers in the winters, and the leg grippers have not loosened from the extra width underneath.

2464,Daniel H.,02 Feb 2021,United States,4,Great Value,"The House Bib Shorts exhibit a great value for the cost. Compared to my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts ($229 Retail), the House bib's pad isn't quite as comfortable, but IT IS much more comfortable than the cheaper bibs I own and very comparable to other expensive bibs such as the Giordana FR-C bibshorts ($250 Retail). I also found the compression to be similar to the more expensive Giordana Bib Shorts. One place I feel like these bibs could really improve is in the straps. They're not bad by any means, but they're also nothing special. The straps are similar to much cheaper bibs I own and compared to the straps on my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts, they're definitely a step down. The straps on my Velocio bibs just feel much more comfortable and luxurious. As for size, these bibs are spot on. I often border on the line between Medium and Large, and upon reaching out to customer service, they advised me to order the Medium. They are compressive, but not too tight, and overall fit great. For reference, I am 5'7""-5'8"" and 170ish lbs. I decided to give these 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like there's room for improvement, but they are a great value. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

2481,Kyle,09 Jan 2021,United States,5,Color is slightly different than website photos.,"Just got my bibs in the mail and love the fit and quality of them. My only issue is the color being a much lighter grey than I expected. I would say they are more of a medium grey while they look nearly black on my Macbook's display. I understand that displays are very different in their color profiles so I won't dock ORNOT on that in the slightest. What I didn't expect were the white bib straps. Not a huge deal but many bibs color match the straps. I understand that it is more cost-effective to have one set of straps for all of the bibs they produce. In hindsight looking at all of the other house bibs the straps are white but it wasn't shown in any photos on this listing as the one photo is could have the wearer has his arms crossed covering the straps. 

Please update the photos on the slate house bibs to include the bib shoulder straps. This would also highlight the very breathable mesh on the bibs that is very comfortable. I also think one photo with all three color options stacked/fanned out would help show the colors better. Referred to the company by The Gravel Ride Podcast. No regrets about my purchase - might have gotten the obsidian in retrospect though.",N/A,House Bib Short - Slate,Medium,N/A

If you have wider sit bones, move around too much and waste energy like I do, you might find the pad shifts from under the bones.
If you ride a comfy saddle or have good natural padding, no issues. the chammy feels great on the undercarriage. ",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

I have issues with silicon leg grippers and it's hard finding bibs that don't have them but these do not have grippers! I own bibs from many of the boutique cycling companies and the Ornot bibs are just as nice for $100 less.

2591,Christian M.,19 Aug 2020,United States,5,"Great bibs, great repair service too!","My introduction to Ornot came two years ago when a friend gave me an already well used jersey and pair of house bib shorts. I loved them right away, and started reaching for them earlier and earlier in the clean/dirty, ridden/unridden laundry cycle until they were clear favorites, in particular the bibs. I sized up to a medium from small for this purchase (5’10”, 155lbs,) and they’re very comfortable. At my size and stature both small and mediums work, it’s just a question of how much compression I want on any given day. For this one I went medium because at the age of 42, I’m unlikely to be shedding any more weight... Anyway, I tested them on one short evening ride, and then wore them for a 160 mile, 13k’ day-long ride with nary a bit of discomfort. They’re great bibs.

Regarding Ornot service: I bought a Magic Shell jacket that I also love, but some stitching began to show premature wear. I sent an email, and got a return label right away. The repair was completed and the jacket returned to me within a matter of four or five days. I can’t ask for more than that! ",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,Medium,N/A

As a point of reference for sizing, I’m 6’1” 178lb with a 32-33”ish waistband and have been using various grades of Pearl Izumi shorts for years, all size Large. Ornot’s sizing is similar.

I’ve had them for a month now and average ~ 120 miles/wk. The material seems durable and the chamois is sufficient. The only thing I’d change are the bib straps. I prefer them a touch more snug.

They also do not move or rub in any weird ways, no matter if I'm sprinting or climbing or anything they stay on like skin. One more thing, the antibacterial microfiber is a godsend.

The chamois gives padding just where you need it, so it's smaller than in some of my other shorts and still more comfortable. By weight (low 150s) I was between sizes but went for Medium. Only comment is that I have some (very very) slight space in the lower back when riding (I'm 5'10'').

One thing I do not like is that there appears to be too much material on the front of the crotch area, which causes me to have a ""moose knuckle"" when standing. In addition, this causes the fabric to bunch up when riding and move a lot. It doesn't appear to impact anything, but I could see it wearing out the fabric faster than normal, since it isn't taut in that area.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

I hadn’t purchased Ornot bibs since the first generation of products and I have to say I was blown away by the improvements. The one thing I wish was that a Small/Long size existed.

2725,Andi,10 Jun 2020,,5,"Excellent overall, one little ******","I am always unsure about sizing for kit. What the guides don't tell you is, for your measurements, just how tight/compressive or stretchy the article is supposed to fit/feel. I find Rapha and Assos bib shorts to be made of a more stretchy material (and even then I size up from M to L). My Castelli bibs are less-stretchy, so the fit for my size feels tighter. As it turns out, these Ornot bibs are on the compressive/tight side. By that I mean the material doesn't stretch as far. So it's a tad harder to pull these on. Once they are on, they feel really good. Not binding, not tight. 

I'm 5'9"", 158lbs,;I ordered Medium (with some trepidation), but I'm glad I didn't size up. These fit spot-on, and there's no odd looseness or flaring around the leg openings.
The one ****** is that there's a little excess bulk at the front of the pad, so when riding out of the saddle I can feel that bulk at the front shifting side to side (my inner thigh that's at the top of the pedal stroke pushes the pad away, and then my other inner thigh comes up and pushes the pad back the other way). >--hope that makes sense! 

I love Ornot's color palette. Was looking for navy shorts but this Stone Blue is unique and looks great!",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

The fit is great, especially around the legs where some elastic bands are awkward, the quality is high and the breathability is perfect. The Chamois is all I need for regular 50-100mile rides.

I don't usually write reviews for contact point items because I think comfort/discomfort comes down to a decent bike fit but these bibs will treat you well if you're pretty comfortable on the bike otherwise. The pad has a lower profile and is more firm than some of the thicker, more plush pads on some of my pricier bibs but I'm satisfied with my experience, especially for the price.

I'm a 31 waste and bought a small, they've definitely got a compressed fit and I almost thought there was no way I'd fit in them but once you pull them up they're perfect.
Chamois is comfortable where they need to be without a huge pad squashing your nuts (not sure why any shorts need to have that and so glad these don't)

I’m 66” tall (some might argue “short”), 138lbs with 24” thighs (ex-speedskater type). I matched my basic size and picked up a small. I found the length and fit around the waist to be spot on.

3077,David G.,13 Mar 2019,United States,4,Potentially rad,"My ultimate basis for judging bibs is longevity: of the seams, the chamois, and especially the fabric. So a couple of hundred miles isn't nearly enough to judge longevity, and given that I bought enough to rotate them each for a ride a week, I hope that I get a couple of years out of them (about 100 rides). 

That said, the fabric is promising. It seems very sturdy, and feels different from the very stretchy feel of the Castellis and Giordanas I've been using and haven't gotten enough life out of. No issues at all with comfort after several hours in the saddle.

Couple of criticisms: the inseam is somewhat short. Maybe I'm dating myself here, but I much prefer the classic fit of bibs, where the gripper would reach a couple of inches from the knee. Nowadays it seems the typical fit is nearly halfway up the thigh, and the House bibs, while not that bad, could be longer. Also, the cut in the front is high, and combined with the stiff construction, makes peeing a challenge; maybe that will loosen up in time.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,,N/A

3111,Thomas M.,15 Sep 2018,United States,5,My Favorite Shorts,"I’ve owned Ornot’s colder weather weight bib shorts since last fall - I quickly realized that they were also my most comfortable. So I continued wearing them even in the warmer weather all year, despite the thermal nature of the fabric. I kept looking to get a summer weight version, but the online store always seemed to be sold out. I finally got a pair this month, and I can attest that the new ones are just as kind to my underparts as the old ones are. Your green pad rules! That combined with great customer service has made me an Ornot fan for life. The handlebar bag is perfect for the long rides. And your socks... Let’s just say they attract a lot of attention. My best story - passing a group of lady riders I got told off for not shouting, “On your right!”, before I overhauled them, then nanoseconds later came the comment - “Oh I guess you thought that wearing socks like those you didn’t need to!”",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,,N/A

3129,Alex,27 Jun 2023,United States,5,Solid vest,"Love this thing. Definitely stops the wind in the front but the back is stretchy and lets the excess heat your body generates out.

3130,Dirk H.,27 Jun 2023,United States,5,Fantastic vest,"At just over 5'9"" and 150lbs the small is a perfect fit. Snug without being suffocating.

The double zipper makes it a little burlier (it feels like the zipper weighs more than the rest of the vest), and I'm not completely sure it's a feature I'll use. But we'll see, I've only had it out on a couple rides so far and it still stuffs easily in a jersey pocket. Fits nicely over the house jersey or a thicker base layer.

The material feels solid, I'm wary of ultra light solutions because of durability, but this vest seems a perfect blend of light but not so feather thin it will tear on the first thing it touches.",N/A,Men's House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,Small,N/A
3131,Warren H.,27 Jun 2023,Canada,5,Perfect weight gilet,"This is great for rides with cool starts or for a whole ride when it never quite gets warm enough.

It also fits beautifully (Size small on me- 5’8”, 155lbs, athletic build). Two-way zipper is a must. It is a big zipper, which I actually like, as it facilitates using it with gloves. If you wear the vest open and the zipper bothers you flapping around, just run it unzipped all the way up. Presto!

3249,Lih C.,25 Nov 2021,United States,5,Great quality,"In addition to the Micro climate jacket, I recently purchased this wind vest. Great quality and stretchy. Similar to the Micro climate, the dual zipper is a amazing feature as it allows a little pressure off the belly when the upper body bends forward in the hoods or the drops, but the stretchiness allows you to keep it zipped down if necessary. The bottom zipper provides good management of ventilation along with the top zipper. Using the high vis Morocco also allows me to just keep it unzipped and let it flap to enhance visibility at night when no wind breaking is necessary. Rolls up to half a jersey pocket.",N/A,House Wind Vest - Morocco,Small,N/A

There is plenty of stretch so it does not restrict movement and I can fit this over a thermal jersey without question. Wore it this morning over a heavy merino jersey (37*F), and cranked 7 miles to work feelin' fine! Never overheated, never felt cold. I cracked the zip down to see the difference and I could feel the cold air blasting in immediately.

3278,Richard,20 Oct 2021,United States,5,"Great, but had to exchange for larger size","This is my first cycling vest and my first item purchased from Ornot. Its now a regular piece of my cycling gear for the 50-60°F days. We haven’t gotten below 50°F yet, but I think it’ll do well with layers underneath. I like the bottom zipper, which opens the vest without having to remove it after you’re warmed up. The color matches the photos online. My one complaint about color is that it may clash with my existing jersey colors, but I’m very particular. Currently, I have a white short sleeve that matches nicely. My other jersey color doesn’t match as well. So, I’m thinking of getting the Ornot long sleeve for better color coordination. But that’s all my opinion. The vest is easy to wash, drys quick enough to be used for the next days ride. If you’re not very sweaty, it might be able to be used a couple times without washing). 

In regards to the sizing, it can be tough to purchase clothing online. Again, this was my first Ornot purchase, so I used the sizing chart. 38” chest, 155lb, 5’8”. The chart indicated I’d fit in a Small. Unfortunately, Small was way way too tight in the front. The back fabric is very stretchy, so the back seemed totally fine. But the front is not not stretchy. It was hard to zip up and I couldn’t zip it all the way up my neck. I thought it might be just how it was supposed to fit, and I prefer a smaller/aero fit. But, I separately ordered a Medium to try it out. The Medium fit much better! I was able to zip the medium all the way up my neck, and it still fits snugly, not baggy at all, which is what I was afraid of going with a larger size. Sending back the Small was an easy process. 

All in all, I’ll be ordering from Ornot again. Next order will be jersey. Because I like their business philosophy (made in USA, sustainable practices), simple designs/colors, and my first experience was great.",N/A,House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

My friend is a big fan of Ornot so I thought I would try out the House Wind Vest as a way to keep warm. I pair it with arm warmers, a base layer, and a short sleeve jersey. It's made a big impact on my warmth and I'm satisfied in that regard. 

I'm 6'2"" and around 172lbs and wear a medium in all of my other cycling kit. Surprisingly, this jersey is a tad tight in a size medium. My one suggestion for improvement would be to add a back pocket panel. I'm not a fan of having to lift up the vest to access my jersey pockets.",N/A,House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

3332,david,02 Jun 2021,United States,5,Sizing wrong - much smaller than a previous Ornot Vest in Med,"6'3"" male, 168lb, 36"" inseam, arms as long, 40"" chest, 32"" waist

I have returned this medium vest (keeping two other items from Ornot given to me on my birthday by my wife). and will re-order it when they have a Large in stock again. 
It was significantly smaller than my other Medium vest from Ornot (almost 4 years old). 
I'm virtually certain that will be excellent given the construction, appearance, price, etc., hence the 5 stars.

BTW: 
- he House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length).
- the Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color let down just a tad by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (may be due to my height and needing a Medium) Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are better",N/A,House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

3339,Warren,31 May 2021,Canada,4,Great vest. Two way zip is key.,"The construction, colour, and price of this vest are great. Work well to block out wind and breathes out the back. Packs up very small. The two way zipper is sturdy and easy to use. Will probably buy another in a different colour. Only give it four stars because I think it would be nice to have a pocket option, but the two way zip does make it fairly easy to get to your jersey.

I'm 6'0, 160 lbs and went for the small. It's definitely tight/aero but there is give in the back material so I'm able to wear it over jerseys with stuffed pockets. ",N/A,House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,Small,N/A

It's been really great for days when the weather changes or starting in the cool morning before it warms up. It is easy to stash when not needed. The zippers are a bit bigger, which are really nice when wearing gloves. The color is fantastic for visibility when on the road. The two way zip allows access to back jersey pockets, but on a long ride (when eating a lot) I'd probably pick something with built-in pockets. I wore this on a 135 mile gravel ride and that was my only complaint (If I had a top tube feed bag I would have been happy). That being said, if it had pockets it wouldn't be so packable. 
In this case, I had planned to use it only in the morning, but it never warmed up the whole day, and I was really grateful I wore it. ",N/A,House Wind Vest - Morocco,Small,N/A

3384,KTS,09 Apr 2021,United States,5,"Windproof, breathable, chain-proof too!","I'm 6'1"" (185cm), 170lbs (78kg), bought a size M and it's a nice tight fit. If I wanted a slightly more casual fit and overstuff my jersey pockets, I might consider a size L. The back of the jersey is made of stretchy breathable fabric, so there's a bit of wiggle room with sizing, and you're less prone to wind up wearing something flapping in the wind like a garbage bag. Also, I love the colors and the lack of logos. Two-way zipper is a big bonus. Also, it wouldn't make sense to put pockets on the back of the vest because that's where the fabric is stretchy and it would just sag.

At first, I was having a hard time justifying the price I paid for this wind vest, but then I had an unfortunate experience. I was wearing a cheaper (not Ornot) jersey, and the loose pockets allowed my stowed wind vest to pop out while I was jamming up a hill and fall directly into my crankset. The vest got stuck in the chainwheel, and also in the rear derailleur cage and brought my pedaling to a halt. After I extracted the vest from my drivetrain and cleaned (most of) the grease off of it at home, I was absolutely shocked to find that the vest had zero holes, rips, or visible damage on it despite being jammed into my drivetrain. So, five stars it is; to me the price is worth it.",N/A,House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

3386,Danny O.,08 Apr 2021,United States,4,House Wind Vest,"I like the vest, and look forward to using the XL that I just ordered. My review is mostly on sizing. I find Ornot's sizing to be very small. I am used to this with bicycle clothing. I am a M in most shirts, but size up to a large for most cycling clothing because I don't like the super snug fit. This L fits me like a non-bicycling S, and I don't like to imagine the Medium. I know that cyclists tend to like things small, but this was REALLY small. I am 5'11 and weigh 182, and needed the XL in this unless you like your clothes very tight. ",N/A,House Wind Vest - Morocco,Large,N/A

3405,Terence,09 Mar 2021,United States,4,"Lightweight and perfect for cool, but not cold rides.","This vest has become one of my go-to pieces of kit on any early morning ride in the Southern California area I'm in. It's warm enough for rides in the low 50s to 60s (F) and light enough to keep on even as temps rise (for visibility with the orange color) and small enough to roll into a jersey pocket if it gets hot. I'm 6ft tall and have a 40in. measured chest with an average build and the size L is ""race fit"" for my body. One area I think Ornot could improve this vest is to add a silicone gripper to the bottom hem and to make the vest longer in the back by an inch or two. If I have stuff in my jersey pockets (phone, wallet, gels, etc) the vest struggles to stay down over the now filled pockets and begins to slide up just to the top of the pockets. I'm constantly in a battle of tugging the vest down while riding and the vest probably doesn't look that good in that position. If you notice, all the marketing photos show the vest is unzipped on the bottom - well that's how I have to ride just so it keep rolling up over my jersey pockets. I've ended up having to put a top tube bag on my bike and store my stuff in there to keep the jersey pockets empty and in the grand scheme of things, it's a bit silly when silicone grippers could just be added to the garment.",N/A,House Wind Vest - Coastal Orange (medium),Large,N/A

3591,Carson,16 Jun 2020,United States,5,Get one. You'll love it.,"I never ride without this vest anymore. On days that start a little chilly or feature a long downhill, it's just the ticket.
The breathable back panel means you don't need to take it off on climbs - just unzipping it is fine.
I love the double zip and the fact that the zipper is beefy enough to use with gloves. 

Don't sweat the fact that it doesn't have pockets - your jersey already has plenty. And no pockets helps the vest fold down even smaller.
I'm 6-1, 185 and the Large is just right.

This stays in place very well and does not flap around in the breeze. The longer hem in the rear is a nice feature, and the two way zipper is very helpful when getting into jersey pockets.

This vest has proven invaluable on days where it's warm down low but cool up high, and/or when I work up a huge sweat on the ups only to sit back and feel my body temp plummet on the descent. Maybe this isn't news to people who are looking at vests. What I can say about this one is it's lightweight, works perfectly, and is really easy to stash in a pocket. Doesn't look too bad, either.

It also folds up extremely small to fit in an already stuffed pocket or an Ornot bar bag mini with other stuff.

The vest is form fitting and stretches where you need it, making it very comfortable and aero. The other pleasant surprise was how valuable the dual action zipper is; not only does the lower zipper allow you to access your jersey pockets much easier, you can fine tune the warmth of the vest by making little adjustments to how far open the lower zipper is... in my first couple rides with it, I kept thinking this is like adjusting the AC in my car 1 or 2 degrees at a time.",N/A,House Wind Vest - Stone Blue,,N/A

Also the torso is quite snug, and the arms are slightly loose.

3910,Jay C.,23 Jul 2022,United States,5,Fantastic looking and feeling,"The jersey is a nice looking one and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. Sizing feels accurate; I consider myself in between a medium and a large in tops being that I am 5’ 8.5” and around 170 pounds and my chest is 40.5” around and torso are more on the wide and round side. The medium I ordered is comfortable but I feel right on the cusp of a large. The only area that gets a little tight is if I keep the jersey zipped all the way up, I usually leave it about 1/4” unzipped so it doesn’t feel like it is pushing on my trachea. I don’t get any zipper bunching while in my riding positions. Like I said though, my measurements put me right on the upper limit of the medium. I could see ordering a large to see the difference. Ornot staff are very helpful, so before you order email them with your measurements and they can help.",3,House Jersey - Fog,Medium,"5’ 8.5”, 170 pounds"

I had a chance to try one out this past weekend for an 80 mile ride. Was 80F and humid, but stayed relatively cool due to the light weight and wicking qualities.

Know that it is a shallower pocket than some other jerseys, but it should still have enough room to fit anything you need. And if not, get a bar bag. Oh, and know that, as others have said, it's definitely tight. I'm 5'11'' and 170-175 depending on the season and I went with a medium.

3973,Jason d.,05 Nov 2021,Australia,4,Nearly amazing....,"This is a great jersey. The design, colour, fit and fabric are all great. I particularly like the cool feel of the fabric and have enjoyed using the jersey in hotter weather. 

It is a snug fit so keeps me honest with my diet (not a bad thing).

The only issue I have is the depth of the pockets. As an example, my phone doesn't sit completely inside the pocket and about 15% of it pokes out the top. As a result I worry about it falling out quite a lot when I'm riding. 

I wear an XS so I am familiar with having smaller pockets. I appreciate that if they're a bit higher they're harder to get into however I'd much rather than scenario than have to worry about the content of the pockets all the time when I ride.

All that said, I have this jersey in two colours and they're my go to as we're heading into summer in Australia.",3,House Jersey - Coastal Orange,Extra Small,175cm 63kg

4099,Jackson K.,04 Jun 2021,United States,5,Awesome!,"So I love everything about this Jersey! There is only one thing I would change. I bought an XS and it was too little so I replaced it with a small. The small fits me great in the chest, shoulders, and length wise. However, the stitching on the arm hole makes it a little tight around my arms, but the medium would be too big everywhere else so I’m sticking with the small.

4101,David,02 Jun 2021,United States,5,Fantastic!,"6'3"" male, 168lb, 36"" inseam, arms as long, 40"" chest, 32"" waist

The House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length). It fits closely but not tightly on me and has very little ""zipper bunch"" when on the bike in the drops or hoods. It might be a tad bit better with a fourth zippered pocket for valuables but not necessary and I knew this when I asked for it, among other Ornot items, for my birthday

BTW:
- the Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color let down somewhat by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (this may be due to my height and needing a Medium but no other bib I have is as difficult )) 
Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are just better but don't have that color!",3,House Jersey - Sage,Large,"6'3"" 168lbs"

4147,KTS,09 Apr 2021,United States,5,"Snug, lightweight, comfortable. A few minor gripes.","So far so good with the House Jersey! This is a great summer-weight jersey, and the colors along with subtle texture and design cues really help it stand out from a lot of other jerseys, without relying on neon logos or ostentatious patterns. Front of the jersey is a tighter-weave material than the perforated side and back panels, so the jersey does a great job of shedding heat.

Fit is tight - this is more of a race-cut jersey. Don't expect to wear it with out bibs, otherwise your navel might be hanging out. That being said, you don't have to size up like many European brands.

Functionally, my only complaints are that it would be nice to have one small zippered pocket, and at this price point it would be nice to see laser-cut seams on the sleeves with silicone grippers, as opposed to the rolled-and-sewn construction. But I can't knock a high-quality jersey sewn in the USA, and given the available colors and the overall quality, I'll likely be saving up my beans to purchase another one soon.",3,House Jersey - Coastal Burgundy,Medium,"6'1"" (185cm), 170lbs (78kg)"

4225,Nicholas K.,13 Oct 2020,United States,4,"Good design and design and colors, long","I bought two house jerseys in different colors, both in a size M. The fit in the body is good, but everything about the jersey feels long. The sleeves come down to the crook of my elbow and the back hangs down my butt a bit, especially with keys, wallet, phone, etc. in my pocket. I took some measurement of the jersey and found roughly the same dimensions when compared to my LS jersey and vest (both size M).

Pockets are the perfect size for storage needs and the sleeves are a good length. Extremely breathable and works well with a base layer as well. I had originally ordered XL but for my much broader shoulders and chest, I had to do a simple return and ordered the new size without a problem. Once the new size arrived it was perfect. Will definitely be ordering others once colors are available in my size. Well worth the price and happy to support this business.",N/A,House Jersey - Unicorn,Extra Large,N/A
4253,michael b.,15 Sep 2020,United States,5,Love the Color Ornot its a winner.,"Love the color and fitting. The color is true to the picture and looks even better in person. The material is a stretch type of material. Some may not like it but I do and many of my friends do. Even though it stretches it does keep its firmness on your body and keeps things correctly in the pockets without stretching downward during the ride. I love this jersey along with the maroon one I bought and the long sleeve lead jersey. The cooling effect is great during he ride. Love them all. Will definitely look at the Ornot line in the future. Winner Ornot to some its a winner to me.

4315,Ryan H.,12 Aug 2020,United States,5,"It's okay to pick favorites, Ornot.","I’m between sizes on the House jerseys, so it's horses for courses: Large fits slightly loose, very comfy and more generous for moving around but gathers up a bit. M is aero-race-fit snug and lays down smooth, good for those purposeful focussed fast days after I've done my push-ups and crunches. It adds at least another 20 watts on the road, Ornot. Like the fantastic bibs, the House jersey materials are super-stretchy and soft, basically disappears once you get moving.

The Morocco color is perfection; not yellow, or mustard, or that safety-neon-green, but somehow all of them together. Looks fantastic tied with the Stone Blue vest and Coastal Bolt Storm sock.

Haven’t come across a jersey made for my body type yet and will admit it is frustrating. I always upsize jerseys but the largest available was an L. I read somewhere I should try out a mens product so I ordered an M based on the sizing chart. I thought it would be roomier but ended up looking and feeling like an overstuffed sausage in it. Regardless, the quality was really high, love the color and the feel of the material. The sleeve length was perfect. Perforation on the back and sides awesome. Providing I could find the perfect fit, I know I would have been very comfortable in it. I also have to mention how amazing your customer service is, the email communication transparent like no other. I love supporting small companies with the right values!

Fit build, but not like the models on this site. I first tried the medium as everybody else in the comments who matched my body type said that was the right size. It definitely fit my arms/shoulders (which are broad) but it was just a little too high on my waist. It didn't show my belly, but it just looked like it shrunk in the front. (my wife immediately noticed and thought it looked funny) I ordered the Large and it's about an inch or two longer and fits great. It's still snug on my arms, chest, and stomach, but has the length I was looking for. The House Jersey is tight no matter what size you buy, so neither the M or the L were saggy or loose for me. If anything, the M was like sausage-casing racing tightness, the L was a comfortable tightness, surprisingly with no bunching or extra wrinkles. I went through the same process with the bibs but ended up keeping the Mediums. I could have worn either, but I have skinnier legs and butt so the M bib was a better fit.",3,House Jersey - Coastal Burgundy,Large,"6'1"", 175 lbs"

Ive never felt so comfortable in a jersey as much as this. Its like I'm wearing nothing at all! 30 miles so far with lots of dirt, water and heat. It was extra ventilated and kept me cool at times I wanted to quit. It does get dirty easy, reaching into my back pockets with dirty hands and splashing through creek crossing but once you get home take it off and just hand wash it and the spots all come off easily. If you leave it in a pile in the garage then maybe the stains will be more permanent but just wash it and you're good. Will be buying many other jerseys in the future.

I bought this color because it is not as hot in the sun and I think it just looks good overall. I have stained it slightly by doing some maintenance on my bike before/during/after riding and then accidentally rubbing greasy hands on it. That is not a fault of the product but of me.

I would also like to see a top stitch along both sides of the zip, as the zipper gets caught in the jersey from time to time. A zipper garage would also be nice. Overall still a great Jersey that is made in the USA. Can’t wait to see what the next jerseys from ORNOT will feature!",3,House Jersey - Coastal Burgundy,Medium,6” 175lbs

The House jersey is just the thing--a perfect fit in an XL--and it breaths well while offering a tad of wind protection. No sags or blowing fabric here. I also own a Preal ozumi jersey which is a distinct cut below the Ornot since it is not lined and has no grippers in the sleeves. But I got the PO jersey because it is bright red and therefore makes me a bit more visible to the giant truck drivers on the streets leading to the gravel tracks.

It breathes well, the longer sleeves don't bunch up my arms like some short sleeve jerseys and it's the perfect fit when you're in riding position. Due to the fact it fits so sleek, definitely ensure you are getting the correct size! If in doubt, contact Ornot. I agree if it had a zippered pocket the jersey would be perfect, but then the price would go up. Minor gripe for a solid jersey at this price!",N/A,House Jersey - Coastal Orange,,N/A

I also have a house jersey from 2018, and I find the orange 2019 to have something a little extra great. The long short-sleeves are perfect, and the material, the COLOR are outstanding. The placement of the pockets is perfect!

I am between sizes frequently... for this one, I went for a race fit which is snug, but as soon as I'm on the bike, I don't even think about the jersey. I'm 5' 10"", weigh about 138 lbs, and chose XS.",N/A,House Jersey - Coastal Orange,,N/A

4614,Erik H.,06 Aug 2019,United States,5,UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE,"Superb. Been a long time fan but admittedly been awhile since new purchases. Did turn a buddy on to you 3 weeks ago and he gobbled up 4 pcs right away and was floored! And when he wore it, I thought to myself - HOT DAMN, time to get back into it - ORNOT... 

I own A LOT of kit; Pedla, Pas Normal, Hunter Bros, Attaquer, Pedal Mafia, Rapha, ENDO Customs, SAS and more...no, seriously, even more - Finch, La Passione, Isadore, God&Famous, Ostroy, MONO, Morvelo...and more. I can honestly say (and this is field tested, multi-brand Owner talking here) ORNOT'S FIT AND FINISH IS UNPARALLELED. IT IS PERFECT, IT IS UNMATCHED AND THE PRICING IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BRAND. And the low key graphics - once considered an alternative to the endlessly ""loud"" offerings which exists, has become the new industry pursuit and now other Brands are chasing ORNOT's minimalist aesthetic which they simply cannot do. Sure, PNS has some cool, low volume graphics based on Skando-design elements BUT THAT AINT NEW and frankly at almost $300 for a F*** PNS Jersey for instance is absolutely ******! And NOTHING compares to the fit of ORNOT - N-O-T-H-I-N-G, I can prove it! 

Love this Brand, always want more.

At 6ft 165 lbs, the medium fits like a glove. The material is the softest of any jersey I have ever owned.

4729,Ken C.,05 Apr 2019,United States,5,Silky smooth in Spring,"Great jersey, incredibly comfortable. At first I thought it was a little too lightweight, but the material is smooth as butter. I ain't mad. It actually made me realize how much more mid-weight & textured my other jerseys are.

FYI: The Navy Line, isn't actually white. It has a slight blue hue; threw me off at first, but I kinda like it

TIP/SUGGESTION: The fabric is so fine & soft, it can actually get caught in the zipper slightly. I didn't experience it when sipping up while wearing the jersey, since the fabric was stretched. But when zipping up before laundering, it was pretty difficult because the fabric kept getting caught. Not sure there's an actual improvement suggestion, but more of a tip and a 'watch-out' when you launder.",N/A,House Jersey - Plum Line,,N/A

4843,Henry,25 Oct 2022,United States,5,BUY IT,"I'm rarely compelled to write reviews - but have so enjoyed my time over the past year and a half with this sweatshirt that I feel compelled to share my experiences.

For context, I am 6'6"", with a true inseam of about 38 in (I wear an XL in rpha t shirts, for reference) and somewhere around 200 pounds depending on my mozzarella intake. I bought the XL.

I've worn this sweater mountain biking, not mountain biking, traveling, gravel griding, Citibiking, walking, hiking, on a boat, on rollercoasters, and in the club. It's been flawless every time. It keeps me at just the right temperature - never more, never less, no matter what I am doing. I would say the range of the garment (with a tech t underneath) in my experience, is ~45 to ~70 degrees - which covers all the riding I do save for proper summer days. Under a wind shell its fantastic for cold riding though I don't do much of that. And I'm finding in places where it's cold in the morning but warms up mid day, it's essential for making sure I don't start off my ride chilled.

Fit is perfect for me. I also got the heavier version of this in XXL - knowing I would wear it primarily off bike. XL fit for my body type is perfect for cycling.

Its only flaw is that it’s starting to bobble a little, sooner than I would expect.

It's a fun piece that I thought I would wear off the bike as well. It doesn't fit that nieche though unfortunately as the elastic on the bottom hem is too strong and rides up too much with an undershirt (or no shirt). Really needs the bib shorts to not expose my midriff. I'm 6'2"" 180 lbs and wear a M in or L in OrNot's jerseys depending on cut. I ordered a L in this piece, and if I were to order again, I'd prob size up to an XL to account for the smaller sizing and tight elastic cuff.

I am 5' 8"" and ordered the M for a slightly loose fit, very glad I did. The inner fabric texture is great, is soft, and gives that nice fleecy feeling of more traditional sweat shirts. The best thing about this, is although it has biking specific features (zipper pocket, longer cut, stretchy fabric, wind resist), it wears and looks like an every day sweat shirt. This is going into my every day rotation. 

I ordered this based on a recent podcast discussing the environmental impact of the clothing industry. The Ornot folks sounded sincere and genuine.

I will say its thinner than expected but great warmth ratio. If you're looking for something on the thin side than it would be 5-stars.,N/A,Midweight Merino Pullover - DRK Sapphire,LARGE,N/A
4988,EB,27 Jan 2021,United States,5,Version 2.0 is even better!!,"I've been waiting for this version. Was hyped on the first one. So much so, I gave it to a buddy who wears it nonstop (and washes it occasionally). I wanted something slightly stretchier, compressible/packable (without sacrificing warmth), and I could push up the sleeves. Whoomp, here it is! Merino/Poly blend is the greatest! This is my favorite sweater, hands down! Will be a staple on many adventures, and around the crib. Now if there were joggers made out of this material, I'd have my off the bike kit covered. Props on another great product!",N/A,Midweight Merino Pullover - DRK Sapphire,MEDIUM,N/A

5032,JDL-PHL,08 Aug 2020,United States,5,Great Lightweight Merino Blend Sweatshirt,"Really nice blend with a synthetic exterior and merino interior - quite unique. It is a lightweight sweatshirt - so feels great for cool days and nights over a t-shirt with shorts or long pants. It vents heat well so you don't get sweaty or smelly - a nice benefit of the merino in this blend. The small pocket is also nice as well and is surely a touch of style your fellow cyclists will notice (and as my wife pointed out it's a great place to stash my COVID-19 mask - LOL). I tried the S and XS and went with the XS, as I think they run a touch big or at least I preferred a closer fit. I'd usually wear a small shirt as a 5'7"" 140-ish lbs guy but the XS provided a closer and more athletic fit for me. Very nice bit of kit!",N/A,Midweight Merino Pullover - DRK Sapphire,XS,N/A

I was a little hesitant about how it would perform on warmer rides, but it's been awesome - stays cool on warm days (70-80) and is so dang comfortable and light weight. It's really nice to have built in UV protection as well. Take that sun!

It's great to see such a rad collaboration between McNally and OrNot. Keep these coming! Ok? Ok.",N/A,UV Trail Shirt - McNally Sketchy,Medium,N/A

I knew I needed a top that would protect me from the unrelenting sun and heat there. I can now report the shirt functioned perfectly on two 6-8 hour rides; the sleeves were long enough to cover my longer than average arms, its material kept me well protected from the sun and 80-85F heat, and the cut was loose enough to breath well, but not so loose as to flap around and get in the way while wearing bib shorts.
