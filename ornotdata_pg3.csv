0,Steven B.,21 Jun 2023,United States,5,Go to everyday jersey,"Love Ornot's House jersey so grabbed a Work jersey as a slightly heavier/roomier everyday jersey for gravel riding and XC. Material breathes well and fits snug without being too ""aero"" of a fit.

1,Martin S.,07 Oct 2022,United States,5,First ride...Ornot,I had been debating buying some Ornot kit and finally pulled the trigger. Very happy with my purchase! The jersey is very comfortable and pockets just the right size. I was unsure of what size to order but pleased with the Medium. I was on the line between Medium and Small. This fits slightly large on me but feels really good. Going to try a small next time.,4,Work Jersey - Gravel,Medium,"5' 7"" ish and 165 or so, sometimes more if I don't ride!"

20,David P.,14 Dec 2021,United States,5,Work jersey works,"I am very pleased with my Work jersey. The workmanship is tip-top and the design very technical for a jersey at this price. The fit is neither baggy nor race tight (I’m a larger rider, working on it :). Most of all, the jersey fits the large sweet spot of moderate to warm temperatures. In my observation there are many fine light jerseys for very warm weather, and thick jerseys or light coats for cold weather, but not as many high quality jerseys for the say 60 to 75 degree middle.

The only bummer is if you carry anything tall in your jersey pockets, such as a mini pump (I'm using a 7.5"" lezyne) it's going to stick out of these shallow pockets a few inches.

37,DAVID L.,23 Aug 2021,United States,4,Good but not great,"I like the jersey. I think it is well-made and fits well. I tend to prefer a form-fitting but not skin tight jersey, so this fits that bill. I do wish for 3 improvements. First, I would rather have silicon grippers or a flat panel on the sleeves rather than the current construction, as I find the sleeves ride up while riding. Second, I find the neck a little high when fully zipped; unzipping slightly fixes this obviously but I wish it was a little lower. Third, the material is nice but isn’t the softest next to skin. I like the slightly thicker material for year round riding but it’s just not as comfortable as I had hoped.",3,Work Jersey - Gravel,Small,5’11 and 150lbs
38,Lawrence M.,12 Aug 2021,United States,5,Comfortable and good looking,"I am older rider who is thin and fit, but needs more core exercise (still though, the jersey fits a bit too loose). The top end jerseys are a bit too snug, but I envy their design and I would prefer wearing those. My wife likes this version a lot, however. My wish is that Ornot creates a ""heritage"" series for us older gents maybe based on this design... and not be afraid to experiment with colors that are brighter since older guys are more concerned about the danger of bad drivers than fashion.",4,Work Jersey - Olive,Medium,"5'10"" 145lbs"

45,Joe,06 Aug 2021,United States,5,It actually fits!,"I finally found a jersey that I like the way it fits! I think a different brand uses the phrase ""A little more Jan Ulrich in springtime than Alberto Contador in July"" and this describes me better than the skinner cyclist dude. I have a few jerseys that I like, but none as well as this. Yes, it's ""tight"" in some places (midsection) but that is my fault and not the fault of this jersey. If I were in better shape, it would feel even better. Fits through the shoulders and chest. have about a 42.5"" chest and about a 35-36"" waist. I also feel ""14% less like a superhero"" all day. I am going to have to order another one of these at some point. Yes, they are a little expensive, but almost all bike jerseys get close to $100, at least at full price. Especially any that are very nice.
Only complaint: the sleeves are too long for me, they almost touch the inside of my elbows. I prefer a shorter sleeve. Very minor, won't stop me from wearing it! Fits is ever so slightly big, but I think a large would have been too small.",4,Work Jersey - Gravel,Extra Large,"5'8.5"" 195 lbs"

171,Raymond C.,11 Aug 2020,United States,5,Nice jersey; fit not quite right on me,"I'm a fan. The jersey is very well made here in the US, and I think it's priced fairly. Ornot's customer service is excellent. I got responses to questions & order tweaks very quickly, and the return process when I decided not to keep the jersey was very easy. Though this item didn't work out for me, I will definitely be back looking for things from Ornot whenever I shop for bike clothes.

Fit was the issue for me. I'm 6'1"" and about 173 pounds. The medium Work jersey was too tight, especially under the arms, and the large had a little too much extra room for my comfort. It felt nice, but I like a more snug fit than it provided so that I'm not distracted by any jersey flapping on the downhills. Basically, I'm sort of stuck between sizes, I guess. I will try a large House jersey sometime because I think with it's more snug cut, a large will be just about perfect.

And I haven't noticed any issues with smell after a few days of wear, so I'm not convinced full merino is needed. I also really like the weight of these. Some merino t's are so thin as to be billowing and fragile in order to be wearable in the summer. These are fine even when the temp climbs but have a heft that helps them wear well. 6'3"" 230lbs and the XL fits perfectly. Looking forward to more colors.",N/A,Men's Merino Tech Shirt - Charcoal,XL,N/A
262,Jeremiah E.,28 Jun 2023,United States,4,Pretty pretty good,"Wore this for three days riding on a bike packing trip through the Shenandoah Mountains in VA. Fit great, kept me from being cold after it rained but also kept me cool when I was dripping sweat after climbs. It never did fully dry out over night and the collar didn’t keep its shape as well as the Ornot tech tees I have, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Still love it though",N/A,Men's Merino Tech Shirt - Charcoal,MEDIUM,N/A

265,Adam C.,27 Jun 2023,United States,5,Comfortable and functional!,"You know how some clothing takes a few wears and washes to break in, Ornot? This shirt falls into the latter group - by that I mean that it arrived fresh and ready to roll.

Sizing is spot on per the measurements provided and the quality of the material is apparent whether you're using this shirt for leisure or during a workout.

Like other technical shirts, this one is warm when you need it and breathable when necessary. With that said, The wool component steps this capability up one notch compared with more expensive tech shirts that I own.",N/A,Men's Merino Tech Shirt - Charcoal,MEDIUM,N/A

Everybody's merino blend is different these days, but this one seems to hit the spot of being durable, comfortable, and excelling at wicking. The fit is also a major improvement over the iteration of the tech shirt that I have. While comfortable, the tech shirt cut always felt a bit off in the sleeves and the fabric on the thick side. Even so, it was easily my favorite riding shirt for all but the hottest days. The merino version is an improvement in every way.",N/A,Men's Merino Tech Shirt - Indigo,LARGE,N/A

303,Nicholas P.,22 Jun 2023,United States,5,Good even in summer,"I'm someone that prefers early morning rides, so although this base layer is meant for colder months, I find that it's still comfortable to wear during early morning rides in the summer when temperatures are in the 70s and 80s.

304,Joe,22 Jun 2023,United States,5,I love these base layers more than my kids.,"Almost. Maybe. Depends on the day. If you're on the fence about wearing Merino next to skin, don't be. I own two and wear them in all their buttery-soft goodness year-round here in Maine. That means from 15 degrees to 90. The fit is killer, so comfortable—neither bulky nor scratchy. Amazing temperature regulation and zero stink whatsoever.

My only thought is that sizing is a little wonky, as with all Ornot. I'm 6'3"", 175 lbs with a super long torso and the medium fits perfectly. Initially ordered a large per the recommendation on the site and was swimming in it.",N/A,Men's Merino Base Layer - Dark Sapphire,LG,N/A

I live in the Bay area where Ornot is located.
I left at sunrise when it was maybe 55F.
Temperatures during the ride went down to 41F and on my way back the numbers climbed back to 82F.
The whole ride I was really comfortable. Had to unzip my jersey as the heat was getting to me at the end but honestly, I can't think of one piece of garment with such a big range of temps.
This is the perfect solution for the crazy micro climates of the Bay Area.
Would definitely recommend.

541,JDL,02 Apr 2022,United States,5,Amazing + Perfect Leg Warmers,"Where have these been all my life!? Another excellent product from ORNOT! I often have problems with warmers falling down on my legs below my bib leg grippers - not an issue here as they go up nice and high. As well, the trick is to pull up the ankle area once you get them on so the ankle isn't pulling down on the legging, if you know what I mean. These are perfectly cut and do not bunch up behind your knee. And they are also not too tight on the knee - an issue I have had with other brands/materials. I think the magic here is the length of these, how stretchy they are, and how they are knit to match a bending leg. Really delighted by this purchase! I was on the fence for weeks over whether to buy these and once I did my 1st ride in them just thought I was a ***** for waiting as long as I did! I would 100% recommend these - they are AMAZING! BTW I am 5'7"" and ~142 lbs and the small/medium fit just right.",N/A,Stretch Knit Leg Warmers,,N/A

543,Edgar,22 Mar 2022,United States,3,Sliding leg warmers,"I've used these a few times now and I can tell the elasticity is not going to last. 
In fact, the first day i received them I put one of the leggings on for a few minutes, and it was already stretched out -
During my second or third ride I could feel them sliding down, and i was still warming up. 
If i put them early in the morning and i'm just walking around the house, they will slide down before i even start my ride. 
Now i make sure to wear them with a newer pair of bibs, to help keep the leggings in place, but i still need to re-adjust during the ride. 
It makes me curious how much testing was involved, if any at all

Note that these have a specific left/right and front/back orientation. Additionally, there's an indicated area that needs to align with your knee.

633,David G.,23 Aug 2022,United States,5,"Good, but you know…","So I’m 6’1, 180lbs, not super jacked in the upper body, but not emaciated either. I bought a medium, and it’s great to wear with a pair of bibs. The fit is on the shorter length and pretty darn snug. It’s a little small for day to day wear, but I still rock it with the appropriate shorts or pants. It’s not particularly light feeling, but it does feel like the weight is well distributed (some shirts feel like they are pulling themselves down because the weight sits at the bottom of the shirt). It feels durable, I’m pretty sure it could survive a fall or two. If I get more for casual wear I’ll try a large, based on the cut it this it shouldn’t be too boxy. My only really strange experience with this shirt is just how small the neck is and the fact that it has almost no give. I have a medium sized head, and it’s a struggle to get it through the neck of the shirt. I have never experienced this before. At times, this can feel restricting, just knowing this is so dang tight. And I grab it and try to stretch it out, and there’s no give. If you have a big head you are gonna have a moment or two when you put these shirts on.

754,Ronan,28 Feb 2023,United States,5,Great cap,"This is a great cap for cold riding. It keeps my ears warm so I don't have to wear ear muffs under my helmet. Secondly, the bill on most caps is too large so I can't see anything when I'm bent forward on the bike, which is almost always. The smaller bill here alleviates that problem to some degree.

799,Lindsay,27 Jun 2023,United States,5,versatile for long rides and commutes too,"Great bag that holds basic flat repair supplies and some snacks on long rides and easily moves over to a commuter bike to hold a lock or whatever else. The structured shape makes it clear how much you can fit into it (and what you can't), and I think it helps me with using the zipper while riding. The bag fits nicely angled a bit under the bars or right out in front. I've only used this on drop bar bikes, but it seems like it would work on any bike. An out front head unit mount does get in the way of accessing the bag while riding, but of course that would be the case for any bar bag. ",N/A,Handlebar Bag Mini - Olive,,N/A

The straps, however are extremely bulky given the small size of the bag. I would have preferred an option to remove the velcro straps and use small voile straps, or similar. By the time you have the bag with the bulky straps, a headlight, and a computer mount, you've essentially run out of comfortable real estate.

It is unobtrusive yet easy to access. The zipper is very smooth to open on and off the bike so there won’t be any fumbling around. 
Thanks to the frame sheet between the fabric layers it holds its shape beautifully even when filled. I have kept snacks, iPhone 12pro, multi-tool, pocket pump and there is still a bit of room! 
It is secure! The Velcro straps with the addition of the tether cord practically eliminates movement.

961,LesKWpg,25 Jan 2022,Canada,5,Outstanding handlebar bag!,"Very happy with my purchase. Even with the Canadian currency exchange and shipping, this little 'mini' handlebar bag from Ornot is WELL WORTH the price when compared to what's available from the usual manufacturers at the local shops. Fits a Samsung Galaxy A8, a standard wallet, Bose Bluetooth earbuds in their soft case, and a key fob garage door opener with plenty of room to comfortably get at each item, so anyone with these very large smart phones should be good to go...(lol, I don't normally carry all that around, just giving an example of the capacity!).

The bag looks very nice when installed, perfect size, not too large or obtrusive. Mounted it on an entry level 'hybrid' bike so the cables aren't as tidy as in the website pics, but the brake and shifter cables aren't a problem as the location of the zipper makes it quite easy to get at the contents.
Very well made...the materials and quality of manufacture are outstanding...short of it going 'missing'... pretty sure it'll last for years to come! Going to be ordering a couple more of these for some other people that I know will want one as soon as they see mine! :)

Customer service and communication from the team at Ornot is world class...again, very happy with this purchase, would recommend any day!

988,Michael B.,08 Nov 2021,United States,4,Great design and look with a potential snag for certain cockpits,"Nicely constructed bag with just the right amount of room for ride essentials, a snack, and an extra layer. The reflective strip of webbing across the front is key for attaching a light or some extra swag with a pin or two, and the front zipper seems to be positioned in a perfect spot for easy access (often overlooked with handlebar bags). 

Unfortunately, I had to knock a star for two reasons. The stiff insert that gives the bag its shape has also proven to be a hinderance in getting the bag mounted correctly on my cockpit. Because of the way my computer mount on my integrated bars is positioned, I am un-able to get the bag mounted flush under the bars. Coupled with the fixed (stitched in place) velcro straps, I'm unable to get this bag to work with my road bike setup and it was a bit askew and awkward on my gravel bikes cockpit. Granted, this wont be an issue for everyone...just keep in mind if you have any under bar computer mounts. All in all, I unfortunately had to return the bag...and that's a damn shame because its the perfect size. I was also a bit disappointed to find a ""Made in China"" label in the bag, but I suppose that was bound to happen at some point.",N/A,Handlebar Bag Mini - Olive,Add Olive Seat Bag +$28,N/A

In particular, the construction is great (not floppy like other handlebar bags), the strap along the front is perfect for clipping on a light and the Velcro straps work really well.

At about 44F degrees, my digits started to suffer, and I switched to a different, warmer pair of gloves, but otherwise these were great. The material is tightly knit, the fit is not too bulky, and the rubber dots are effective. I don’t think I would race with these—they are ever so slightly too “loose"" for maximum control under duress. But for training miles, they are just fine. Great for off-the-bike usage, too.

1231,Nic,22 Jun 2023,United States,4,"Great concept, loosens over time","I love elastic belts. I love how you can get a custom fit almost every time and have a little give so you don’t feel cramped. I’ve had this guy for not quite a year and use it as my work belt. Really like it, but it definitely loosens every couple weeks. Not bad, but I definitely notice my pants are loose again. Very nice if you want something to wear going out or cruise and not have some bulky buckle and waist constriction. Magnet buckle is very secure.",N/A,Stretch Belt - Black,,N/A

I’ve worn this during everything from summer rides when wearing baggies, to backcountry skis when wearing snow pants. As a daily wear, sometimes not enough tension as a normal belt provides as it IS quite stretchy, but when you need that stretch, boy does it fill that niche. Bought as an add-on to a kit purchase while visiting the shop in SF this summer and I’m sure glad I got one!

1275,Eric,12 Oct 2021,United States,5,Fantastic!,"I'm a belt wearer and my current nylon belt is getting frayed. I was in the market for a new one when this popped up. I was slightly worried about an ""elastic"" belt but it actually works very well. The magnetic buckle is very snazzy and I like it a lot. Sizing; I wear 33 pants (slightly lose) and this fits me. But I would think that 36-38 would be absolute max based on remaining fabric. Only downside I will comment on is because this belt basically has 2 ends (meaning there's connectors on both vs basic nylon on one), it is not so easy to 'pull through' the belt. I constantly move from pants to pants to shorts to pants and its been a learning curve to not just yank it through. There's definitely a preferred way it likes to go, but still not silky. Still like it!",N/A,Stretch Belt - Black,,N/A
