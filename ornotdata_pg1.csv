0,Bryan,22 Jun 2023,United States,5,Good jacket on and off the bike,"This is a versatile jacket for wet and not so wet with the removable vest. The stretchy flat finish fabric looks good and sheds dirt and water. The arms are a tad long for casual wear, but make sense on the bike. The rear pocket is perfect for the bike.",3,Men's Trail Magic Jacket - Black,,"5'6"", 130 lbs"

2,Michael W.,28 Feb 2023,United States,5,Great all round jacket but not fully waterproof,"I love this jacket. I wear it everyday, both on the bike and off it. It’s comfy, warm, had good pockets, and great features like a large rear pocket, warm liner, and a big hood. 

There are a couple of things that I’d love to see in version 2.0 which include:
- full waterproofing. This current version seems splash proof but it definitely isn’t fully waterproof. Any moderate to heavy rain will soak the jacket
- elastic cinch straps around wrists and waist. This would be great for keeping the wind out of my sleeves!

Ultimately, this jacket is great, I’m very happy with my purchase and would buy it again.",3,Trail Magic Jacket - Gravel,Large,"184cm, 85kg"
3,Nicholas,12 Feb 2023,United States,4,Functional with a great fit*,"I put an asterisk for great fit because the jacket is marketed as something you can wear on and off the bike which is true because the cut is different compared to regular cycling clothing, however the sleeves are far too long for shorter people. I'm 5'7 and typically wear jackets with 32-32.5"" sleeves because anything longer will results in the sleeves bunching up. The sleeves when straightened all the way out cover half of my hand. The long sleeve length is perfect for when you're on the bike, but since the jacket is marketed towards on and off the bike wear, I would have liked to see a more normal sleeve length. Perhaps incorporating velcro cuffs so you can still block wind from coming in while riding and having a more normal sleeve length would have been a better option, at least to me. 

Functionality wise the jacket is perfect. I got too hot in it in 45F weather with only a thin long sleeve and short-sleeve jersey underneath so if you frequently bike in cold weather, this jacket will work well. The back pocket is nice for storing extra gubbins if you don't want items in side pockets dragging the jacket down.

I'm someone who likes things to fit a certain way and have strong preferences, hence my tirade about sleeve length. I kept the jacket because it still provides utility for riding despite the fit making it a no-go for casual wear (for me). Overall I am satisfied with the product.",4,Men's Trail Magic Jacket - Black,Small,"67"" 140 lbs"

10,Andrew N.,29 Jan 2023,United States,4,Pretty nice,"Overall this is a pretty nice jacket that has served me well in mild to somewhat chilly rides. I appreciate the flexibility of vest + outer shell. As a tall person, I appreciate the sleeves are a pretty good length on their own and if tucked into a glove for colder days. I have two minor nits that prevent me from giving five stars. First, it would be nice if the sleeve cuffs had a Velcro strap or elastic to control airflow up the sleeve. Second, pit zips would be really helpful to moderate temps too.",N/A,Trail Magic Jacket - Gravel,Medium,N/A
11,Ian B.,26 Jan 2023,United States,5,Great Design!,"I love the versatility of this thing. With the included vest and a long sleeved base layer this can easily get you by in sub freezing temps. Love that the hood

12,AC,15 Dec 2022,United States,5,Allllmost perfect for winter,"I have an earlier version of the magic shell jacket (without taped seams) and I love it. This jacket is a little different in some key ways. I bought the Trail Magic jacket during the fall sale, which was the only way I could justify it. It's definitely warmer and I often find myself overdressing on 25-40 degree days. It's kind of a mind-bender how few layers are needed with either of these jackets. As I've not dialed in the layering aspect, I'm not sure if there's any difference in breathability between this jacket and the shell. I appreciate the extended zipper length at the throat. I like the hand pockets and the rear pocket is cavernous. The fit is looser, but still comfortable and not flappy. I'm not thrilled about hoods in general, but this one feels unobtrusive. I'm 70"" tall and 160# and the medium fits me well with enough room for a layer. So what would I like to see change? For the most part, I would like to see additions. I really wish that Ornot were less stingy with reflective bits, especially on shoulder/winter season gear. The sun sets at 430 and conditions can be crummy and I don't want to be worrying about whether or not I'm being seen. My magic shell is morocco in color, but the jacket is a sort of greyish blue or blue-ish grey - take your pick, either way, it doesn't lend itself to visibility in less than ideal conditions. Finally, I feel like I actually need to stop for a photo or to check/send a text. I've been keeping my phone in the big back pocket and while I can access it while riding, it would be a stretch to call it convenient. I would much prefer a zip Napoleon pocket. Overall, I'm very pleased with this jacket and I appreciate that it's made in the USA.",3,Trail Magic Jacket - Gravel,Medium,"70"", 160"

20,Cameron G.,15 Nov 2022,United States,5,Limited Experience - So Far So Good,"I live in Southeast Michigan. I’ve cycled in this jacket three times. Once, it was around 45˚F. The jacket was great. I also used an Ornot longsleeve merino base layer on that ride. I removed the inner liner for this ride. The jacket blocked a decent amount of wind and kept me warm.

The second ride was at Iceman Cometh in Traverse City, MI. The temps during the race were about 60˚F with a lot of humidity. I was extremely overdressed for the race and had to stop to shed this jacket and my base layer. I was also wearing the Ornot long thermal bib, which was way warmer than I needed too. (I’m new to riding in colder weather…)

The third ride was 32˚F with a decent amount of wind. This time I wore the base layer, a long sleeve jersey, and this jacket with the liner. The climbs were warm, the descents were chilly (but not frigid), and everything else was fine. 

I haven’t yet exposed the jacket to extreme rain during a ride. I’ve been dumped on while standing around in it, and I didn’t get soaked. So that’s good. 

TL;DR: my experience wearing this jacket is limited. It has worked well so far. I have not tried any other brand’s jacket that is specifically marketed to cyclists, so I’m not sure whether paying almost $400 is worth it. But it’s doing well so far.",3,Trail Magic Jacket - Black,Medium,"5’ 10”, 155lb"
21,Josh W.,10 Aug 2022,United States,4,Great jacket but not 99% waterproof,"I wrote a review previously and gave the Trail Magic five stars but I wanted to give an update but I was not able to edit the previous review. So I took along this jacket on a trip to Spain and rode through northern Spain this past April. It rained lightly and I was confident that I brought along the right jacket for the job, I was wrong, the jacket dose not repel water. Water absorbs into the shell material and eventually all the way through very shortly. Again it was a very light rain. After riding with this jacket for 10 straight days there are two things that I would have liked: 1. a chest pocket for passport/wallet/cell phone. 2. a different material just around the cuff that won't fray or get damaged by Velcro from riding gloves. Beside this, I still love the jacket, I like that the hood actually covers my helmet, the fit is perfect (not baggy and not to slim), can add warmth when needed with removable vest, and the jacket fits in off the bike as well.",N/A,Trail Magic Jacket - Gravel,Medium,N/A

28,Chase V.,09 Jun 2022,United States,5,The ‘Perfect’ jacket,"What else do you call a jacket that works its way into your heart and becomes your favorite piece of clothing? It is the perfect weight, keeping you comfortable on cool, misty mornings and evenings when the chill comes in just after sunset. It has a light layer of insulation inside, which can be removed if temps are moderate, so it can serve as a light shell. Or keep the insulation in, add a light layer underneath, and it can manage some reasonably chilly conditions. A brilliantly versatile design.
Plus, the windproof fabric is soft and comfortable to the touch. The fit is just right; trim, but not tight. The sleeves are long enough to get all the way down to the wrists, no annoying gaps where painful bits of cold air can intrude, solving one of life’s thorny issues...

The fit is great - I was deciding between a small and medium and really glad I got the small. Fits well even with a base & thermal layer underneath.
I also wore this (without the thermal vest layer) for a 45 degree rainy outdoor cross training session. I put a long sleeve t-shirt on over it to provide a little protection against abrasion (we were doing situps and other stuff on the ground) and this jacket kept me insanely comfortable.

38,Alexander H.,13 Mar 2022,United States,5,Great Jacket!!!,"I’m relatively still new to cycling and don’t like riding with a jacket (I get hot too easily). The shell breathes so well. The vest was perfect as a morning layer for below 50 degrees riding up Hawk Hill. Actually saw another rider wearing the jacket on that ride and chatted him up about it. Was so impressed with the jacket (sized M for riding) I purchased another jacket (sized L) for work purposes for layering and how well in breathes during movement as I tend to sweat at my job moving heavy things.

47,Townsend M.,06 Mar 2022,United States,5,Perfect jacket,"I bought this primarily as a off-bike, casual rain jacket. So far I’ve found that it is also perfect as a light windbreaker. This thing is absolutely comfortable. Not the least bit rubbery or sticky feeling like some other rain jackets. The material is honestly a miracle. I’m serious when I say that I grab for this jacket now when I might have otherwise reached for a cotton hoodie. I did find it ran a touch small across the chest. I’m solid a S in Ornot tops but when the S arrived I found it a bit constricting in the body, and as I was using this off-bike mostly, I returned for a M (which is perfect). Had I planned to use this whilst cycling I would have stuck with the small. Sleeve length is very ample (even on the S) - and I have long arms.

48,HS,05 Mar 2022,United States,5,"Perfection, even down to ~-10C","As a woman forever buying men's Ornot (I'm 5'10"", 165# and wearing a Medium), I can say this one is worth the $$ and is the only jacket I need for a complete/functional kit for a wide range of conditions. The dual-ended (bi-directional?) zipper is amazing when I'm wearing a base layer + cap air crew + included vest and need a tiny bit more room in the hips to be comfy. The arms are quite long but work perfectly on the bike for those of us with swimmer arms, especially if you don't mind cuffing off the bike. The large zip pocket isn't the most flattering when wearing many layers but the vanity hits are worth it for the cozy points. 

Might wish for a back vent flap or pit zips if Ornot plays around with design in the future, but the zip from the bottom helps sufficiently with this. ",N/A,Trail Magic Jacket - Black,Medium,N/A

Fits like a glove, keeps me toasty, yet unbelievably breathable. So far, I have opted to mostly wear it without the fleece vest liner. But, the vest alone has already proved to be an awesome warmth boost during the awkward shoulder season in the CO Rocky Mountains. I thought I might fall between SM and MED as I generally do, but given the more relaxed fit of this jacket, the small fits great - plenty of room to still be worn more casually, yet slim enough to make me feel slick on the bike. One thing I am concerned about is durability… at $384(!!!!) I'm feeling a bit cautious wearing this on single track through trees/bushes.

RIP old Rapha rain shell, I’m probably not going to wear you again.
The trail magic shell is just so good. Stretchy, breathable AND waterproof is no joke. It’s so comfy and also functional. The vest isn’t really my style to wear on its own but the extra layering option is nice for sure. I’ve used the new jacket for snowshoeing, shoveling snow, chopping and hauling firewood in the rain, yadda yadda. If you can afford this jacket it is absolutely worth the price.

In all other Or Not long sleeve jerseys, I wear a Large and the fit is perfect--the sleeves extend to my wrist (difficult for me to find in a large jersey from other brands). So, I ordered a Large in this initially. Both sleeve length and torso length of the jacket were shorter than the jerseys. Or Not was stellar with the customer service and made exchanging it for an XL easy.

The XL fits through the torso perfect, now. the sleeves are about a half inch shorter than the jerseys, still (see the photo for comparison of this jacket to the long sleeve lightweight jersey).

100,Brendan H.,22 Jan 2023,United States,3,"I want to love it, needs a few adjustments though.","I bought this jacket in November and I live in Washington DC area so I have had some time to try in a mix of conditions. There is a lot to like about this jacket. The material is great - it is stretchy in a way that helps it disappear when you wear it. The material is also very breathable and has worked for me in a wide variety of conditions/temperatures. The zipper also feels solid. 

The issues appear however with a couple of other design elements. First, I bought this jacket in a large size and I am 6' 1"" and 175 lbs. I feel like I have pretty standard build. I have found that the large size jacket feels a bit short in terms of length through the torso as well as in the arms. For the torso, my regular jersey that I wear underneath is about 3 to 4 inches longer than the Ornot jacket and the drop of the back of the jacket is not very pronounced compared with most of the other jackets I have owned before. Similarly, the arms feel a bit short and I think that they could benefit from a bit of a silicon grippers inside sleeve where the sleeve sits on the glove. I have found that especially in bumpier gravel the sleeve creeps up toward the top of the glove.",2,Men's Magic Shell Jacket - Morocco,Large,"6' 1"" 175 lbs"

A merino baselayer, thermal jersey, and the magic shell keep me perfectly warm without things getting swampy, and a quick unzip can get me through warmer spots without a problem. Even when the jacket is just on the verge to being too warm, as soon as the group stops and the heart rate drops, I'm glad to still be wearing it.
As far as fit goes, I took advantage of this color running 1/2 size smaller. I'm a dead ringer for a small, but a medium in this color gives me enough room for those two layers underneath without feeling constricted. However, I just wore it out over a t shirt today for a rainy errand, and it felt great then as well, so I'm sure it has enough stretch to accommodate layers even if you don't try to game the sizing.

153,Ray S.,21 Feb 2022,United States,3,Mixed feelings,"My experience is mixed. I've worn the jacket in temperatures from 33-55 degrees F. For the colder ride, my arms were a little cold with 2 layers underneath but only one was long sleeve. For the warmer ride, I did not overheat. So, the jacket has a wide range of temperatures where it works well. My base layers for all rides have been dry, so the jacket does vent water vapor. I have not ridden in the rain, so I can't comment on how it sheds water.

I gave the jacket 3 stars for two reasons: 1) The available colors. I see lots of people riding in black, so it is obviously a popular color. However, I think it's unsafe. You don't see road construction workers wearing black safety vests. And the Morocco is about the most ucky yellow I've seen. (I did buy it though.) 2) The almost unusable pocket. I don't really care that pocket doubles a stash bag. I'd rather have some real cycling pockets and a separate/stand-alone stash bag. Also, the zipper on the pocket is hard to use. To zip it up, you have to reach around back with your left hand and hold the jacket down and then pull up with your right hand at just the right angle. Luckily, the jacket does have two very good front zippers. You can unzip from the bottom to gain access to jersey packets. 

I bought the medium. After first trying it on, I debated whether to exchange it for a large since it felt too tight. But since I'm 5'4"" and 145 pounds, I thought a large just wouldn't be right. After wearing the jacket though, I'm glad I kept the medium. The stretchiness allowed a close fit and was not uncomfortable. 

Even with these negatives, I still think the jacket is a good value. I did look at jackets from other companies and found some that claimed similar functionality at much higher prices.",3,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,Medium,"5'4"" 145 pounds"

one of my favorite aspects of the jacket is how well-constructed it is, and compared to other winter/windproof/water-resistant jackets it's wayy less bulky. a phenomenal piece for commuting - early mornings are cold af in los angeles. it's not cheap, so take care of it

i normally do lots of climbing and descending, which means big changes in temp, wind, weather. this jacket might be overkill for most socal riding, but for winter it's amazing. if you're riding in the santa monica mountains, angeles crest, etc, you'll probably overheat on the way up but will be very thankful at the peak and on the way down. when i rode up in port reyes area this winter it was amazing. if ornot would send me a discount code best believe i'm getting a micro climate for the rest of the season. only two jackets you'd need, as far as i can tell",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,N/A

171,Benjamin L.,19 Dec 2021,United States,5,Great jacket!,"Used my Magic Shell for the first time this morning, and it definitely impressed (as did the Micro Climate I also got, but that's for another review).

With this Magic Shell, I went out today in 34 to 60 degrees this morning. Underneath I had a long sleeve fleece thermal jersey and a summer sleeveless base layer and was totally comfortable, although I had to unzip all the way at around 58 degrees. I'm impressed by how well these jackets can block the wind, yet still breathe well, and they fit well so there's no flapping around while riding. I have older wind jackets that would always be noisy in the wind, or inflate up like the Michelin man - definitely not very aero.

I tried almost a dozen other jackets from Rapha, Pearl Izumi and Castelli and compared against these 2 and the Ornot jackets just fit better with the stretch fabric, look great, and are easier to use with the bigger dual zippers. 

I'm 5'10"", 155 lbs, typical cyclist arms, and a little squish around the middle. The medium Magic Shell fits snug with the thick fleece long sleeve jersey but still comfortable and not tight.

187,Jeff S.,14 Nov 2021,United States,5,Best Piece of Cycling Clothing i Own,"The only thing debatable about purchasing this was the color. I went with Morocco and I'm happy that I did for visibility purposes. This jacket is wind proof, water proof, breathable, and warm. Too warm, unzip from the bottom. Hot, unzip it all the way. Rolls up easily and fits in a jersey pocket. I'm 6'2 and 158lb and bought a large. I debated an XL just because of my arm length but it would've been baggy. The price was a little hefty but luckily I had a 20% coupon from a recent Ornot bibs purchase and used it for this. What are you waiting for?

189,Scott,10 Nov 2021,United States,5,Shockingly perfect!,"Im not one to write reviews but as they help me so much, I thought I'd give one on a product that surprise me tremendously. I really ""researched"" what jacket to buy as I tend to geek out about stuff like this and obviously settled on the Magic Shell. Like many here, when it showed up, I thought no way does this keep me warm in NE Ohio as its so light and small. Boy has it surprised me so far! I've used it in 25 degree (F) to 55 degrees and its been perfect in both (in fact, this past weekend, it warmed from 25-62 during a 3 hour ride!). Conditions like that make it almost impossible to dress properly but with the ability to simply remove some layers, I was able to stay comfortable the entire time out. I've used it in heavy rain and 41 degrees and sun and 55. Amazingly, the most I've layered is a thin base layer, long sleeve jersey, and the Magic Shell. I run cold so that really says a lot! The two way zipper is also a feature I was surprised by. I honestly didnt see the big deal about it until I began using it. What an incredible feature (I will never own another outer layer that doesnt have this as it allows for more heat dissipation if needed and better, really easy access to jersey pockets). If I had one nit about the jacket it the lack of an open external pocket. I actually wish it had a chest pocket for a phone. Certainly not a deal breaker. The fit is awesome with no flapping around (I'm 5-9"" and 152lbs and medium is perfect). Basically fits like a winter jersey but lighter so I can actually put it in a pocket if needed or pack it if bikepacking. The ""Magic"" comes in how it regulates heat. Sure, its wind and waterproof but what sells me is that I am never really cold or really hot when I am wearing it. As I heat up even a little, I can actually feel the heat dissipate keeping me dry and right on. Its honestly like having a thermostat set to auto! Hard to explain but I think Ornot has made the perfect jacket here. I havent had a chance to ride in really cold temps with it yet (below 15 deg F) but I suspect that a merino base layer, mid layer, thermal jersey and the Magic Shell and I should be good to go without looking like the MIchelin Man. Hope this review helps if you are in the market, This is definitely one of the best gear purchases I have made.

206,Tim A.,05 Oct 2021,United States,4,Magic Shell -,"The main goal of this review is to help my fellow cyclist feel more confident about size selection. I am between sizes so I spent more time than any reasonable person would reviewing the size charts and reading other user reviews. I am ultimately not 100% satisfied with the size I ended up with.

The jacket itself is very nice. It truly does work like magic. It’s light yet warm and you don’t feel clammy as you begin to sweat. I would say it’s worth the money if you ride in cold weather. 

Back to size selection. I had ordered both a Medium and a Large so that I could try on both. Ultimately returning the one that didn’t fit. Ornot’s size chart had me squarely in a medium. When I tried the medium on at home it immediately felt too tight. The large felt less so but still had good compression so I went with the large. The mistake I made was thinking that the fit experienced in my living room would be the same fit on the bike. 

While out riding on my first outing with the jacket it felt like it was too loose in the sleeves and I noticed a little flapping around the neck and lower back.This bugs me and I wanted to return it but Ornot’s return policy does not allow for worn garments. Even though it was within the 30 day exchange window. 

This is my mistake and I am 100% accountable. I am still disappointed when Ornot said they couldn't exchange it unless they charged me an arbitrary restocking fee. My mistake but I wasn’t willing to pay the penalty. 

Go by the sizing charts and think about how the fit will be while riding and you should be fine! If you like it a little loose then size up but if you want that nice performance feel while riding the sizing charts are on the money!",4,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,Medium,"6’1"""

223,RC,09 Aug 2021,United States,5,Great jacket,"I ride a lot in the early morning during the summer. Where I live, that means it's usually in the 50's when I set out, and it's windy and often foggy to the point of mist. This jacket is perfect for that weather--just a base layer under it and I'm good to go. I have no doubt that it will keep me warm on much colder days if I put a thermal jersey or a more substantial base layer under it. I'm very happy to have something that covers such a wide temperature range. 

I love the zippered pocket and would love it more if it were bigger; it does hold my phone, though, which is the main thing I want to put in it, and I could easily get a bar or two in there as well.

If you're in between sizes like I am, here's what I decided on: I'm about 6'1"" and 175 pounds. I tried both M and L. The M fits me a little more tightly than the fit that's pictured in the main photo above. The L has enough extra material that it didn't feel right. The zipper on the L bulges out in a couple of places when I'm standing and really bulges when I lean over as if on a bike. The fit in the back with the L is a little loose, and with the M it's snug. The arms on both jackets are long enough that they didn't factor in. I went with the M because I wanted a really functional, on-bike fit and am OK with how tight it is. I'd say the advice Ornot provides on fit is spot on. I should have just trusted their table/advice and gone with M to start with, but I wanted to be really sure I was getting the right jacket. Hopefully I'll help someone else feel confident enough to order just one size and avoid the return process.

My upper body might be considered slim to most non-cyclist, but it certainly doesn't resemble the physic of a climber in the peloton. 95% of my upper body attire is medium in size. Nearly all of my jerseys are also a medium, while my bibs are split between a large and medium. I purchased this jacket in a large and it's perfect. I've only used this in temperatures ranging from 15 to 40 degrees F. On the coldest ride, I was wearing a lightweight long sleeve merino wool base layer and a heavier weight long-sleeve cycling jersey beneath this jacket. Everything was snug but not uncomfortable. Adding a layer or the thickness of one of those layers would make the jacket too tight. That said, I was plenty warm at 15 degrees F with that setup (note that I'm in Minnesota and might have a higher tolerance for cold weather cycling than most). For rides near 40 F, I had just a lightweight merino layer and it was nearly perfect in temperature and fit. The stretch of this jacket is absolutely wonderful.

278,Brian B.,25 Jan 2021,United States,5,Fantastic Rain Shell,"Even though it's meant for rain, I typically use it anytime temps drop below 50. Breathes really well for a waterproof jacket. Bottom zip is a bonus as you can quickly bundle up for the descent without stopping. 

One nit: I'm 6'2"", 190# with long arms. Size L is great but I could use another 1/2"" or 1"" of length in the back. Put anything in your jersey pockets and you're compromising lower back coverage on those cold, wet days.",2,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,Large,"6'3"" 190#"
279,Bryan,23 Jan 2021,United States,5,Another Winner,"Wore this today for the first time. Ride started at about 50 degrees, went as high as 55 and as low as 48. I wore this and a DeFeet Wool base layer only. The jacket kept me warm for the most part. jersey underneath would have been perfect, but that is no fault of the jacket. It was super nice to zip up or down when climbing and the wind block on the decent was unreal. Depending on weather and what I wear underneath, not sure I need another jacket.

295,Justin G.,23 Dec 2020,United States,5,Great jacket...,"Great jacket...I’m a pretty consistent and normally proportioned size medium and the arms were a bit too long so will get them shortened when the weather turns dry/ warm. I would also reconfigure the pockets to include 2 regular external pockets with a zipper dry pocket. These aren’t a reason to deduct a star...just observations. The single zipper pocket on only one side is a bit small if you’re trying to carry normal pocket things/phone, etc., and being only on one side makes the jacket a bit lopsided. So I only use it to hold small things or nothing and keep the normal stash my jersey pockets as needed. Adding these features would likely increase the price by at least 50 bux so for the money it’s probably the best jacket out there.",3,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,Medium,5’8” 155 lbs
296,Russell B.,19 Dec 2020,United States,5,Believe the Hype!,"After realizing that layering works best for me, especially with this Magic Shell, I actually sold off and gave away my other season/weather specific jackets, because this replaced all of them. 

This jacket breathes amazing and does not overheat especially with the 2-way zip during tempo efforts. It does not get clammy.

This guy blocks out the wind great and does not make a single noise or flap while riding. 

The stretch of the fabric is perfect. With my thickest wool jersey underneath it still looks and fits great.

I've been wearing this jacket for the last few weeks and love it. It's warm, but not too warm that it's unusable when temperatures climb during longer rides. The sweet spot for this jacket is between 45-60 degrees, though you'll get too warm in the mid 60s+. It's also stretchy, water resistant, nicely tailored (perfect arm length for me), and it's well made. I love the 2-way zipper and the single back pocket is perfect for my small point-and-shoot camera.

The shoulders and sleeves are roomy to layer underneath, but the jacket still tailors nicely to the body for a close fit (no extra flapping fabric in the wind).

Took it out for a few rides so far and a run in pouring rain to see how it holds up in inclement weather and I have to say... the material is fantastic! Surprised that it doesn’t smell up like others do so I can get a few uses out of it before having to wash. My real issue is sizing. I had to purchase a men’s size L to fit myself in it because the females sizing only goes up to large - I’m a large in casual clothing but ornots large runs small. The mens fits me just right in the torso, but the sleeves are way too long and unfortunately too small in the waist. I look like I’ve stuffed myself into a sausage casing in the waist section and it rides up when fully zipped. I wish ornot would consider that not all women who ride have an athletic build and provide sizing and cut made for the fluffier riders who like a looser fit. Oh well.. it will motivate me to lose my belly fat faster because I really do love this jacket.",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,Large,N/A
324,Benjamin S.,27 Nov 2020,United States,5,Worth the Money,"I wanted to wait on writing a review for this jacket until I could put it through the test of wearing it on a cold, rainy day. It did not disappoint. Water beaded up on the surface and even though I perspire a great deal, the jacket never got damp or clammy on the interior. In my opinion, this jacket will keep you plenty toasty with the right layering underneath in temps as low as the upper 30s. It's absolutely perfect for rides (and runs) when it's in the 40s & 50s with just a lightweight base layer.

The fit on bike clings to the right spots and not the wrong, while off bike the jacket is almost passable as “normal” clothing, I plan to pair it with your Mission short for shorter gravel shreds. I’d be excited to see more bright colored options, maybe some added reflexivity. I’m often leaving when it’s dark in the winter so increased visibility is very desirable. One thing I absolutely would not change is the two way zip, it’s one of my favorite features both pragmatically, and yeah, **** it, for style points.

341,Sam B.,17 Nov 2020,United States,5,"Love it. Breathable, keeps me dry and warm, sturdy.","Got the jacket a few weeks ago. Sized up to a Large from my normal M and it fits really well. It’s a really versatile layer and has been perfect for the changing weather in Portland, OR—worn it over a base layer in more mild weather, layered it up when it’s gotten cold. It’s kept me dry in the rain and didn’t even tear when I crashed descending in the rain this weekend. 

One thing to know: it’s fairly bulky and doesn’t compress a ton, so if you’re looking for a shell to carry with you for the occasional shower I’d look elsewhere. That’s not a fault of the jacket, it’s just the tradeoff you get for the soft breathable material.

The dual zipper is also another awesome touch.",3,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,Small,5’10” 140lbs
343,Yeen,09 Nov 2020,United States,5,The real deal,"Ok they absolutely nailed it with this jacket. I was looking for an aero fitting jacket that is stretchy and comes in a color other than ""run me over black"". This one looked like it would fit the bill so I pulled the trigger after reading some positive reviews on it. 

Breathability is amazing, I tested this doing hard vo2 max and long 40'+ threshold efforts up climbs in 30-50 deg and never have an issue getting soggy except minor sweat on arms, the torso and armpits are very breathable preventing any sweat buildup. 

Windproofing is really good as well, so you don't get cold on fast descents. I just rode this jacket for 4 hours in the snow @ 24 deg f and was not cold at all so it can handle the lower temps for sure. I have been layering with a merino longsleeve base and jersey for most rides. Above 50 deg F I would be unzipping or layering down. 

A size medium fits me quite snug as an athletic build 5'9"" 165lb, if you are concerned about layering underneath I would size up to a large, but personally I enjoy the tight fit. Also the jacket is tapered at the bottom so it doesn't bunch up on your stomach when you're in a riding position. I really like not having jersey style pockets in the back because I prefer to use my jersey pockets underneath and find them to ruin the aesthetic of the jacket. The jacket is also very lightweight for the warmth it provides. 

The only thing I would change is to reverse the zipper direction on the back so that zip-down is to close the pocket instead of open as it is much easier to close zippers down when using gloves and this is becoming common practice for most ski jackets nowadays. Other than that this jacket is definitely badass and worth the money imo, would be cool to see some more colorways but I enjoy the hi viz green.

I now consider it's lightness the main advantage, stretchy, very versatile (65deg to 20's), great fit, and looks good.

(My easy remedy is wearing a jersey underneath.)

That aside ... form, fit and function are superb! I ridden in heavy SF fog (i.e. drizzle) and even one heavier shower, staying perfectly dry. And as a layer on cooler morning rides, it's awesome. Breaths well, and the dual zipper helps regulate temperature.

This is LITERALLY magic.

Heck, I’ve even worn it in light wind and never overheated. I loved it so much I got it in every color available. The rear pocket is a dream. Far too many jackets pile jersey-style pockets on the rear of the jacket which seems absolutely pointless to me. I already have three small pockets on my jersey. The pocket here is large enough to stash a baselayer or vest or whatever I need. It’s easy to access should I put my phone back there and need to snap an emergency selfie.

466,David G.,12 Mar 2020,United States,5,Flap-free waterproofing and warmth,"I've bought several Ornot jerseys in Medium and have been happy with the fit, so when I saw that the size chart for this jacket had me on the upper edge of Small, I was hesitant to order that size, but the stretch video made me willing. Glad I did -- snug, but comfortable. Sleeve length is fine, and the stretch allows pulling them over the cuffs of rain gloves. On the rare snow ride in upper 30s with a Gabba jersey underneath, I was afraid of the amount of stress I was putting on the zipper with loaded jersey pockets, but I guess that's a reason to get a bar bag. Speaking of pockets, that's the one gripe: the zipper pull on the back pocket is pretty useless; it's really small and hard to feel with gloves on, and it's a contrast to the main zipper which is sturdy AF. At least the main zipper has two sliders, so you can get to your jersey pockets easily.

467,Paul P.,06 Mar 2020,United States,5,Magic ✨🧙‍♂️,"I have been wearing this jacket every day in pretty much whatever weather: really cold (layer underneath), cool and foggy, 30s, 40s, even into the 50's. It's been a real trooper.

Finally got some decent sprinkle on my ride today and it didn't wet through, which I totally thought it would, so that's pretty cool. I assume if you do a long ride and there is lots of rain it will eventually soak through, but pretty impressed with the water resistance this jacket offers.

I have even worn this jacket with no shirt or jersey underneath (don't ask). The material is comfortable against your skin, unlike every other jacket I've ever had which all felt like wrapping yourself in a plastic bag. 

The only thing that would improve this jacket would be a bit of elastic at the wrists, they can be a little flappy at times, but this is really picky.

AS far as sizing, I am tall, with weirdly long arms but also pretty thin, so nothing ever fits me 😂 . I went with a size I thought would be long enough but not so flappy around the waist that it wasn't good on the bike. It almost is long enough in the arms!

468,Tim M.,29 Feb 2020,United States,5,Believe in the Magic!,"Today was my first ride with my new Magic Shell Jacket. It was a chilly, blustery day that included climbs, descents, and an ocean stretch into a headwind under a wind advisory. The temps ranged from upper 40s to start to mid 50s by the finish, but there was the wind. The jacket performed flawlessly, keeping me warm and comfortable the entire ride. 

I tend to fall in the gap between L and XL depending on brand and cut, so I ordered both sizes and elected to stick with the XL. I am happy I stayed with the XL because I tend to layer more than some and had not problem wearing the jacket over a base layer and short-sleeve jersey. The material is lightweight, soft, and have others have commented, well-made. It's a high-quality jacket.",3,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,"5' 10"" 195"
469,Naz H.,25 Feb 2020,United States,5,It's definitely magic,"I've not been a fan of cycling jackets in general. They've either fit me like a deflated hot air balloon, have terrible packability, or are for the hardcore days (i.e. Rapha softshell or Hardshell). 

My first encounter with something that straddled the line between weight-to-warmth, waterproof-to-breathability, and had good fit and finish was Castelli's Gabba line. But even those pieces were too warm if the temperature rose a little, and packability, even on the vest was still relatively large.

I live and ride primarily in the Bay Area so temps range from 40s to 60s in the mornings and in the winter, the temps can stay right around that 40-50 range. A ride can take you against the sun, but then into a back valley that drops 10 degrees. A jacket like this keeps all of those concerns away. Paired with the PowerWool thermal jersey, you're golden.

Layer with a thicker base layer or wool, or even a regular LS wool baselayer or Henley that's not cycling specific, and this jacket is casual and high-performing enough to carry you through a wide range of temps.

I love that it fits more like a jersey and has a lovely soft handfeel but is still a shell — they are not kidding about the stretch!

You know how everyone loves a ""shacket"" these days? This is that for cycling. ",3,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,"5' 8"", 140lb"

475,Dan B.,17 Feb 2020,United States,4,Almost Perfect,"Firstly, I really love this jacket and would definitely recommend it. The build quality is top notch and I love how breathable it is but yet does a really nice job on the decent sun blocking out the wind. It’s perfect for changing conditions. The only downside for me is that it does not have rear pockets. With a jacket like this I would love to just use it with a short sleeve or long sleeve base layer but this is really not possible since nearly all base layers don’t have pockets and the jacket doesn’t have pockets I have no wear to store my extra gear. As a result I need to wear one of my long sleeve jerseys with a pocket which in certain situations is just not as efficient as having a simple base layer. Even with this slight limitation, this is still my go to gear!",3,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,,6’ 1/2” 175
476,David C.,15 Feb 2020,United States,5,It is magic!,"On the first ride with the Magic Shell, I only took it off once when the sun was on for a full few miles, afterwards in the shade the thermal and breathability aspect as well as moisture repelling all came through.",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,N/A
477,Ryan D.,14 Feb 2020,United States,5,Lives up to the hype--no cap!,"I almost bought this jacket multiple times over the last two years, and truly regret it took me this long to get it. My first impression when the package first showed up, I was so surprised at how light the jacket was. 

We have had some super cold mornings in LA recently and the jacket has been perfect for the 30-40 degree temps. I have paired it with the Power Wool jersey and it has been the perfect combo for my rides. The Magic Shell's balance between blocking the wind and still being breathable is truly what makes it magic. 

Clothes always fit me funny because I have random measurements (5'7"" 190lbs 34 inch waist and 42 chest), so I went with the Large. It fits me perfectly with exception to sleeve length. I kind of knew that would be the drawback to getting the large, but it fits perfect around the chest and waist as well as over the Power wool jersey.",4,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,"5'7"" 190"
478,Lo,10 Feb 2020,United States,5,VERY impressed,"I've worn this jacket three times now and got caught in the rain twice; last weekend put it through the wringer in a 70-mile ride in 40 degree weather with on-and-off freezing rain, wind, and one heavy downpour. I was suspicious at first, because it really does look like the fabric wets out (gets a lot darker and wet-looking) but NO, after five hours I was totally dry underneath, just a little damp from sweat. Wore it with nothing but an Icebreaker merino longsleeve underneath and was toasty warm the whole ride. I was debating between this and a Gore ShakeDry jacket but I'm glad I went for this. I'll definitely wear this on dry, cold days. 
I'm a woman, so the sizing isn't going to be perfect, but the Small is roomy enough for a LS jersey underneath. I'm usually an XS in men's stuff at 5'7"" 135lbs w/wide shoulders. The sleeves are definitely long, and I'm going to have to get the waist tailored in. 
I dig the two-way zip, but wish the back pocket zip pull was just a little more hefty. Trying to grab it with gloves on is close to impossible. It would be great to see a women's version in lighter colors too!
Also just curious how quickly the material would get damaged if you wear a backpack or bag over the top?",1,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,,"5'7"" 135lbs"

I've owned 6+ different waterproof/breathables spanning the different membranes (gore, event, neoshell, etc). I even have another neoshell jacket, and this one is by far the best. The thin construction, stretch, and snug fit make it feel like it disappears. It is the only waterproof jacket that I don't end up totally sweating out, yet it is still waterproof. It does tend to ""wet out"" quicker than a hard shell, but all the pros far outweigh that.",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,N/A
487,Lesley,28 Jan 2020,United States,5,Awesome lightweight but warm jacket,"Bought this jacket for my husband and was instantly jealous that it isn't made for women. Contacted Ornot peeps to ask what size I could buy for me. I normally wear a large in women and went for the small in the men's. Tested it this past Sunday with a 45-55 degree day that included a big cold descent in Colorado. It was awesome. I love how small it packs up so I could ditch it for the uphills and when the sun was out. 

I had the same issue as some other reviewers with the sleeve length - they are really long. I expected a little bit long since I am a gal, but they were super long. I will have the sleeves altered to make them perfect. If I had a wish list, I'd request this in navy blue and grey, a version especially for the gals and shorter sleeves.",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,N/A

495,Joseph K.,19 Jan 2020,United States,5,Three winter rides in January. . .,"Took new Magic Shell Jacket on three winter rides in January in Massachusetts. Cold (30F), cold and rainy (33F), and warm and sunny but 20MPH+ winds (37F). Varied weight of my base layer to match conditions. Rides were 25 to 35 miles.

Impressions: exceptional comfort, exceptional wind resistance (felt the cold temps but not the wind chill), exceptional breathability (no residual moisture inside the shell at the end of the ride).

Side entry back pocket took some getting used to (and the zipper pull is teeny): but then realized that the pocket is essentially a stuff sack since it is not stitched to the jacket on the sides. With that eureka, figured out how to load: backup layer first, then backup hat, then food, then phone.

512,R.A.,11 Jan 2020,Canada,5,Neoshell is the best material for high intensity,"Have worn a Neoshell jacket for years and it cannot be beat for breathability - you will never wear anything else. All other shells are plastic bags when worn for high intensity activities. With Neo, you are always dry. Ordered the magic jacket hoping it would be more like a svelte, long sleeve jersey rather than my more technical shell and it is bang on! I bought size small. I am 5’8” and a trim/lean muscled (but not skinny) 145 pounds. The length is cut just where you would expect for a performance race fit. Could be a fraction longer but definitely wouldn’t want it any shorter. It’s very trim, but perfect for club roadie rides when you wear aero, tight stuff. Def not for my more casual gravel or mtb rides in that size. It’s exactly perfect for what I bought it for. Hope the size review helps. ",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,,N/A

(Side note: Ever dream of feeling like a Compass tire? This may be as close as you'll come.) And whereas other shells enable to you become animal like a mud-loving bivalve, i.e., clammy, this one keeps you chill, fresh, and looking smart. I don’t know anything like it. It’s the best garb I got from these people at Ornot. If you want to shell out the clams for this thing, you may just love it, too.

529,RB,02 Jan 2020,United States,5,This jacket is legit.,"First real cycling jacket after I moved up to a colder climate. Got the preorder (burgundy) and finally took it out yesterday. Wore it in 40 degree weather with a thin long sleeve base layer underneath and felt spot on the whole time while doing some hill repeats. Could probably wear the same items into high 30 degree weather and still be OK. Blocks out the wind like a suit of armor, haven't tested it in rain yet. The back procket is great and the fabric stretch makes it comfy AF.

Only issue I had was the sizing but the folks at Ornot were great on the return. For reference I am 5'9"" - 170 with a 44"" chest. Definitely on the thicc side and I initially ordered a medium which made me look like I was stuffed into a a sausage casing. The jacket still fit although stretched to the max. Sized up to a L and it fit perfect. Sleeves are a touch long now but nothing I couldn't get hemmed locally to take the extra 2"" off if I needed to. 

Just buy it.",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Morocco,,N/A
530,Allan,30 Dec 2019,United States,5,"Great fit, I personally needed to size up","Great fit, nice long sleeves which do not ride up when I am stretched out on the bike. Very stretchy for a waterproof jacket, which is nice. Keeps me warm, or at least not freezing cold, even on long mountain descents (think Diablo in winter...). Breathes quite well, but if the temperatures warm enough, it does get somewhat stuffy. The material on the inside is a bit ""grabby"", so I always wear arm warmers so it will not stick to my skin, even if it's just thin sunsleeve material. The easiest way I've found to take it off is just pull your arms out and then flip the sleeves back. Doesn't really pack up small like thinner vests and jackets, so I just roll up the body and tie it around my waist (I don't care what it looks like haha!) The large rear pocket is nice for storing larger items, but with the double zip, it's very easy to access my jersey pockets. Haven't ridden it in the rain yet, but a few times I've splashed water on it, it beads up nicely. One note about sizing, I normally wear a size small in Ornot jerseys, but the small jacket was too tight for me. I'm 5'9"", 64kg, with a more athletic build, the jacket was too tight around my chest and back, and on my shoulders. Sized up to medium, and it's a much better fit (though I wish I could have kept the size small for the fit around the lower torso!). ",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,N/A

565,Frank S.,29 Mar 2019,United States,4,"Comfortable & warm jacket, just needs pockets","I needed something better than your standard wind jacket for the winters here in the NYC area and the Magic Shell really nails it. It's blocking enough to not need a ton of layers under, but allows you to breath fairly well when stopped. The zippers make it super easy to let adjust for extra breathing. The one thing it could really use though is some kind of pocket either in the chest or a single back zip. The intent is to use while windy & cold so having to dig into a jersey would defeat that end goal.

574,Frank S.,29 Mar 2019,United States,4,"Comfortable & warm jacket, just needs pockets","I needed something better than your standard wind jacket for the winters here in the NYC area and the Magic Shell really nails it. It's blocking enough to not need a ton of layers under, but allows you to breath fairly well when stopped. The zippers make it super easy to let adjust for extra breathing. The one thing it could really use though is some kind of pocket either in the chest or a single back zip. The intent is to use while windy & cold so having to dig into a jersey would defeat that end goal.

I usually ride in temperatures ranging from high 30's to 40's and were this jacket over a long sleeve jersey or long sleeve base and jersey and stay pretty comfortable during short and long rides. Would definitely recommend this jacket to those riding in similar climates. My only complaint is the nylon flap behind the zipper is too light and tends to get caught in the zipper itself.

I’ve gotten to test this out on handful of chilly rides now the latest being a gravel ride this past weekend. I can say every time I pull the Magic Shell on it performs admirably. The breath ability factor alone is worth. I don’t finish felling damp or soaked. I used it this past weekend with the OrNot long sleeve base layer and a jersey in 55 F and windy conditions and was comfortable the entire time. The only thing that leaves me wanting more is if it had a back pocket for storage. Not a deal breaker but would add functionality of having items readily available instead of unzipping to get into my jersey pockets underneath.

Fit is perfect for a regular/sprinter sized human and having the water proof feature with a jacket that doesn’t crinkle like an empty Doritos bag or flap in the wind like a sail all while feeling substantial enough to wear just as a wind blocker is amazing.

610,Matthew M.,06 Feb 2019,United States,4,"Close, but not quite","The neoshell material is great, and works as advertised. Light, strechy, highly wind and water resistant. The medium was a perfect fit for me (5'9"", 160-ish, 41"" chest), slim fitting without feeling too tight, plenty of length in the sleeves.

However, the zipper/draft flap combo ruined this jacket for me. I could not reliably use the zip (especially the lower one) without it getting fouled in the draft flap material, sometimes to the point of worrying that I wouldn't be able to get out of the jacket. I ended up returning mine, as this isn't acceptable at this price point (to me). Fix this issue and I'd buy another one without hesitation. Kudos to Ornot on handling the return. If you don't typically adjust your zipper while out on a ride, this may not be an issue for you.

Things I'd like in the next version - reflective tabs sewn in the seams at the wrist, maybe sewn down the length of the jacket in front of the zipper as well. A chest pocket would be nice, but isn't necessary, provided that the 2 way zipper functions flawlessly.",N/A,Magic Shell Jacket 2020 - Black,,N/A
611,John J.,06 Feb 2019,United States,5,"To Simply Put It, This magic shell is amazing!","I saw this item on the ornot Instagram and was drawn to it due to the fact that the material was in collaboration with Polartec. I currently work at a boutique in San Francisco that produces outer where with Polartec fabric and instantly knew this item would be a winner.
To begin, I ordered my true to size as suggested by Ornot and though my initial wear of the shell, I felt that it was a little snug after 2 rides it had stretched to a comfortable fit. 
Currently, I use this shell for early morning cold and damp rides but also use it for my commutes to school and work. This shell is breathable but yet holds in heat giving me the perfect level of comfort. On my colder rider, I simply wear a base layer and then my shell as the jersey and it has been nothing less than amazing.

One thing that drives me crazy is the length of fabric behind the zipper gets caught very regularly. It is hard to remove, especially while riding and even moreso with heavy gloves on. This could be a heavier material to prevent this, or have a thicker edge.

628,Joshua P.,02 Feb 2019,United States,5,Magic Shell Jacket,"I’ve really struggled with finding jackets that are waterproof and fitting in the past. Not only that, but it’s also a chore finding waterproof jackets that breathe. Usually, after a few miles it feels like you’re wearing a trash bag. But the magic shell is so dope. First, the zipper works great. Doesn’t snag or get caught up. The actual material is so comfortable and warm. I wore it on a somewhat cold Austin morning, I think the temperature was hovering around 40 degrees and it kept me warm and comfortable. Again, this jacket breathes! It’s so great. Lastly, when Ornot says waterproof, they mean it. I haven’t tested it in an extreme downpour but I’ve tested it with rain and mist and it kept me dry. I highly recommend this jacket. I’ve seen some people complain that there are no pockets on the back but I didn’t care and I’ve gotten a few compliments about it. I think it gives the jacket a cleaner look.

674,Richard,23 Jun 2023,United States,5,Perfect wind breaker for face paced rides,"I really enjoy the microclimate jacket. The material is extremely stretchy and comfortable. I feel like it does a great job at preventing wind chill and pairs well with the micro gird jerseys. It was tough it decide between S and M, as I wear M in Ornot jerseys. Ultimately, I went with the S as the material feels like it wraps around my body better and has less excess material flapping around.",2,Men's Micro Climate Jacket - Stone Blue,Medium,"5' 8"" at 135lbs"

This jacket has seen me through surprise hail and downpours with remarkable effectiveness (my lower half was soaked, upper half did alright!) and it's become a standard part of my kit.

It is intensely comfortable due to the soft texture of the material, and it moves beautifully with you on the bike. My only quibble is that I want to wear this jacket with a base layer - which would dramatically expand my ability to wear it - but the lack of pockets (ignoring the zippered side pocket) prevents that. The real shame is that if I’ve got to put a jersey underneath it - to carry my stuff - it’s got to be pretty darn cold for me to wear it.

Also, I love paring the micro climate jacket with the Micro Grid Long Sleeve Jersey. These combos kept me soo comfortable on my winter rides. The Lofted layers do fade after a while.

The fabric seems softer so it doesn't sound like you stuck a plastic bag in your car window and drove along at 50 mph. I don't know if the little bow tie insulation nubs keep you warmer compared to a normal wind jacket but it doesn't hurt.

The color is great, sort of a lime type color that offers low light visibility and doesn't scream 90's era vehicular cyclist bike advocate uniform.

The only feedback is on the collar and waist. The collar could be higher to block out the wind from going down your chest.

Firstly, let me say thank you to Ben for ensuring the shipment happened as soon as possible, since I decided to go for the Ornot jacket at the last minute, so that I would get it before I left, which I did.
Secondly, what a great product! It fit nicely in my back pocket during the Mt. Ventoux climb (Malaucene side) and, after summiting, it provided relief from the wind and chill of the descent, all the way back to Bedoin, where being in the low 70's, it quickly went back in the pocket.
We repeated the climb the next day, from Bedoin this time, and the jacket came out at Chalet Reynard as, you guessed it, it was super windy, and it stayed on until we reached the lavender fields on our way to Sault.
Extremely happy with the fit and temperature range of this Ornot product.

774,John B.,25 Sep 2022,United States,5,Perfect for shoulder season,"I find the stretchy fit of the Micro Climate jacket to be well nigh perfect. It’s a snug fit with a light later underneath and doesn’t flap annoyingly on descents. However, that stretchy fit also easily accomdates additional layers as the temperature drops.

It is very easy to put on and take off on the move, with the cuffs, in particular, aiding that task. The two way zipper is easy to engage and moves easily too.

Finally, the material breathes outstandingly well while the subtle insulation works really well on chilly descents.

I really can’t find any details to complain about on this jacke!",3,Micro Climate Jacket 2021 - Morocco,Medium,5’10”/1.78m 160lbs/72kg

780,Charles B.,04 Sep 2022,United States,3,"Neat tech, fits small with sleeves shorter than other Ornot items","I loved the lightweight, stretchy fabric. The fit is intended to be like that of jerseys. I was disappointed that the sleeves were much shorter than on size Medium jerseys and sweatshirts from Ornot. I think the short sleeves were compounded by the upper back being slightly too tight, too, which pulled slightly on the sleeves.

It's the middle of winter here in Australia and morning rides can be cold. This jacket has now become a staple every time I head out for a ride. It's very comfortable and the stretch really makes the fit fantastic on and off the bike. In the past I've resorted to wearing arm warms under a LS jersey with other jackets. With this one the arm warmers can stay at home due to the added warmth of the jacket. This warmth comes with zero bulk however and the jacket packs down nicely. That said, with a double zip for ventilation options I rarely take it off. Very versatile! Love it.",N/A,Micro Climate Jacket - Stone Blue,Extra Small,N/A

791,Nate M.,19 Jul 2022,United States,5,Outstanding packable jacket,"I purchased the Stone Blue Microclimate jacket which was back in stock just in time for a trip to San Francisco and a climb up Mt. Tam, and was not disappointed (by either the garment or the ride)! After building up my bike near the Golden Gate Bridge I threw on the jacket knowing it was going to be windy crossing over the bridge. I took it off once the climb up Mt. Tam started and was feeling a bit toasty. Quite pleased with how easily it stuffed into a jersey pocket even sharing a space with my cell phone. After rising above the fog it got a little chillier and windier and I put it back on. On the descent to the north, it was getting later in the day and there was condensation dripping from the denser forest sections. With the swifter speeds and less sun exposure I was glad to have the protection from the Microclimate. The double zipper pull, at first glance a minor detail, is key when it comes to fine tuning the temperature control and accessing the jersey pockets without stopping. The material excels at keeping out the wind yet is breathable when working hard. When wearing it you don't even notice it's there, which is exactly what you want from any piece of cycling kit. Back home in MN, I plan to use it often on early morning or later evening rides, especially in the spring and fall. Love the color and the fit is spot on.

It felt fine when just trying it on, and I can pull the sleeves down for comfort, but they soon ride up again.
I have a long sleeve jersey and a Trail Magic jacket in the same size (S), and they are fine, which leads me to believe that this is connected to the Micro Climate Jacket. Looking at the model in the photos, I would guess that he would have the same problem as I.

826,Tim A.,17 Apr 2022,United States,5,Fantastic Addition to my Cycling Wardrobe,When I first starting riding I purchased a cheap nylon jacket from one of the big online bike retailers. It felt clammy and served as a parachute while out riding. Needless to say the Micro Climate Jacket is lightyears ahead of my first jacket. You should trust the Ornot size chart. Mine fits perfect. Snug but too much so. The material is stretchy and gives you the freedom to move. The jacket truly does perform in a wide range of temperatures. On my first ride wearing the jacket I left the house in 61 degree weather. While out riding the temperate fell to a cool 48 degrees. Unzipped going up the climbs but at the temperatures dropped I remained comfortable. The material on this jacket is incredible and it packs down small when not needed. Buy with confidence. You will love it!!,3,Micro Climate Jacket 2021 - Morocco,Medium,6’1” 160 lbs
827,BW,15 Apr 2022,United States,5,Perfection,"I was really in the fence about this jacket for a few months. I was not sure about the weight and definitely was not sure about the Morocco color. I did not want another fluoro colored jacket. The first time I used the jacket was at the Fish Rock race. The morning temperature was cool and the first part of the ride covered steep terrain on shaded roads. Although this jacket feels light it works perfectly for blocking wind and breathing. I wore it for half of the ride until the big climb and warm temperatures hit although I feel like I still would have been comfortable if I left it in. For the color, I am very pleased that it is not a yellow as the pictures show. It has a bit of muted olive tint to it which is very appealing and unique. On the Fish Rock ride there were at least 6 people who commented on how great the jacket looks and especially the color. It packs up very small to fit in my jersey pocket too. I’m convinced this is one of the most perfect jerseys possible. Definitely give it a try. Just wish I would have waited to get the free macgyver strap.

It breaths well thanks to less wind fighting fabric in the back. I'm 5'9"" and about 141 pounds with about a 37"" chest and the extra small fits perfectly. I typically wear a small jersey, but several reviews suggested going down a size. I emailed Ornot and they concurred based on my skinny measurements. The size provides me with an aero fit but not too tight. Love the two way zip so I can get to my back pockets or let in some air. Some have found the sleeves too long, but I haven't found that to be the case. The zipper pocket is handy, but at least one more packet for a snack would be nice. Folds up to fit in a jersey pocket.

Glad I don’t have to ride to Mt Doom but if I did this is the jacket I’d take with me.,2,Micro Climate Jacket 2021 - Morocco,Medium,5’9” 172 lbs

888,Michael B.,10 Jan 2022,United States,5,Worth the Investment!,"I held off on writing a review for this jacket until I could get some milage on it. I just finished a 7 week training block with a lot of early mornings on the coast here in So Cal.and I'm really impressed. This jacket replaced a lightweight ""breathable"" pro team jacket by another manufacturer (rhymes with Mafa) . That jacket was not what I'd refer to as super breathable, nor have any others that I've tried. I'm a real Goldilocks when it comes to finding a good lightweight jacket. I tend to burn up in everything I try. The Micro Climate Jacket nailed it though. 

Function: Cuts the wind. Keeps you warm. Breaths insanely well. I was actually able to keep this jacket on and zipped up during some early morning climbs and even during a few interval sessions on mornings that were in the low 50's. Thats rather remarkable. Its perfect for long descents and early/chilly starts in anything from about 45-60F. It'll keep you dry in dew/fog and light or short rain burst...and most of all it doesn't build up condensation inside. 

While its not the world's most compact jacket (I assume partially due to the heavier weight zipper), I do really like that if folds up into its own pocket. I find it a little too bulky for a jersey pocket, so I either stuff in it an empty water bottle cage or use the MacGyver Strap (sold separate) to affix it under my top tube on two bottle rides. That solution works out pretty well. 

Fit: I'm 5'10"" long torso, 148lbs, 37"" Chest, 30"" Waist and I stuck with an XS even though the size chart put me in a Small...and I'm glad I sized down. The material is super stretchy and I don't like my kit to flap around or bunch up. There's plenty of room for a lightweight LS jersey, and base layer underneath. Shoulders and chest feel good. The neck is perfect (often an issue for me on smaller sizes), and the sleeves are more than long enough. In fact, I feel like they are a little too long. 

The colors are take it or leave it. I missed the train on the Sage, and would have liked to have seen a little bit more vibrant shade of blue, but its still very classy and neutral. The yellow is just a little too much for me though. 

Its a spendy piece of kit, but well worth it. Its definitely a quality investment that will pay returns on the bike for seasons to come.",4,Micro Climate Jacket - Stone Blue,Extra Small,"5'10"", 148lbs."
889,Justin H.,03 Jan 2022,United States,5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This is the perfect layer for morning rides that start cool and warm up, or rides with big climbs / cool descents. My main likes are that it has a good balance of wind blocking and breathability, the stretchy fabric allows it fit well without flapping, and it packs down small when things warm up. I'm also appreciating the two-way zip and the single pocket design. 

I'm between sizes L and XL, I bought both and kept the XL. It fits well over a thermal jacket for rides in the upper 30s to 50s.",3,Micro Climate Jacket - Stone Blue,X-Large,"6'2"", 195 lbs"

897,mark m.,30 Dec 2021,United States,5,Awesome Micro Climate Jacket,"In a nutshell - I love this jacket. Used it for the first time here in the Los Angeles basin. Temps started in the mid 40's and I had a thermal long-sleeved base layer, a vest, and the Micro Climate Jacket. Worked up a sweet but the breathability of the jacket handled it just fine. Eventually ditched the vest. I'm not a ""race fit"" rider by any stretch of the imagination, 205lbs at 5'10"" so I ordered the 2XL. A little long in the sleeves but not a big deal. Fit great around the torso and easily handled that layers I had under it. Would a ""relaxed"" fit or fat guy version fit better, sure, but this thing works so great I don't really care. I tried wearing it around town in short sleeves and I never had that clammy feel that's common with a shell. This is going to be a go to item for temps in the mid 50's and below from now on. Packs so small it easily fits in a back pocket or a 1L handlebar bag.

This would make a cool around town hoody for casual use (non biking) on cool days where there's a chance of rain- just saying. Oh in a relaxed fit or course.",N/A,Micro Climate Jacket 2021 - Morocco,X-Large,N/A
898,Allen V.,27 Dec 2021,United States,5,Perfect weight jacket that checks all the boxes,"Riding in southern California can be tricky and I own several thinner wind jackets but I was looking for something slightly thicker but still easily storable and this jacket checks all the boxes for me.

In the 40s, I paired with Eliels Palomar for a warm, wind shielding combo.

Yesterday it was high 50s - 60s, wore it over a jersey and it was a perfect regulating layer. Didn't need to unzip on high output climbs.

It even crosses over for MTB use.

908,Lawrence L.,13 Dec 2021,United States,5,Fuzzy dots really work,"I recently had the chance to test out this jacket on a ride with temps that started in the low 40s and climbed into the mid-50s. The inside of the jacket has a bunch of fuzzy dots that in addition to feeling soft and luxurious against your skin create a thin air layer to help with insulation and moisture management. It sounded a bit gimicky for what otherwise looked like an expensive long sleeve jersey, but a friend really liked his and I've had good success with past Ornot products. The little dots actually work. I sweat a lot. This jacket performed magnificently, but for some reason the back of the jacket doesn't have the dots. Wouldn't having the dots in the back also help with breathability? I was between this and a Shakedry. I passed on the Shakedry because I don't get much rain. My top priorities were breathability and packability. My Rapha wind jacket seems to pack a tiny bit smaller but this Micro Climate does a much better job breathing. I do wish it came with the standard 3 pockets in the back. I'm 5'6"", 150lb and got the medium. I think the medium was a good call since the original plan was to layer it and use it like a jacket. I think it'd work great by itself too or with a base layer. The material has a nice thin stretch to it. I hope it holds up long term.",3,Micro Climate Jacket 2021 - Morocco,Medium,"5'6"""
909,Colin S.,08 Dec 2021,United States,4,Pretty great piece of kit,"I've only had a couple of chances to use this jacket but both times it impressed. Stretchy, sufficiently long in the sleeves, and decently warm for its small size. Jury is still out on if this is redundant or complementary to my wind vest, as it packs down to just about the same size and is maybe only slightly warmer for your core (breaths very well), but at the very least it is nice to know that the micro climate offers greater overall protection in the cold damp months. The morocco color perfectly toes the line between visibility and playing nice with some of my other kit. It looks great with navy bibs and an orange thermal, for example. Have only received compliments. As mentioned, I had to size down from my regular size (small) for a perfect-to-snug fit over a base layer and thermal jersey. 

Besides the sizing, my one quibble is that the two-way zipper is nice, but the bottom zip doesn't ""lock"" into the end position as well as I'd like. That is, it doesn't take much force to get the zipper to unseat itself so it can start unzipping upwards. I imagine that would be pretty annoying if it inadvertently happened on a ride. Hasn't happened yet, maybe will never happen, but I just noticed it wasn't as locked-in as my other pieces with two-way zips, such as my Voler vest.",3,Micro Climate Jacket 2021 - Morocco,Extra Small,"5'11"", 135 lbs"

915,David G.,06 Dec 2021,United States,5,Strikes the right balance,"On a hilly foggy morning ride, with descents and climbs, and temps in the 50s, the jacket did a great job at keeping me both warm and ventilated; wearing a LS light jersey underneath. As the morning progressed, I was able to keep the jacket on until it got well into the 60s and the sun came out. You might be thinking it's nuts to spend this much on a windbreaker, but it's much more than a plastic shell: there's attentive placement of tiny fleece on the interior, and the exterior fabric and stretch panel eliminate flapping. The double zip is an excellent feature, and it baffles me why so many vests and jackets don't use it.

Only minor issue is the zipper garage at the bottom of the jacket. Riding with full fingered gloves makes it hard to find by feel the small zipper pull tucked into the garage, and the garage makes it hard to zip up the jacket from fully unzipped. I appreciate the minimalism of having small tabs without pulls, but in this case the tabs could have been a touch bigger, or the bottom garage could be eliminated.

Very happy with the purchase. I sized down, making for a more race-cut fit. The stretch keeps it comfortable and snug.",3,Micro Climate Jacket - Stone Blue,Small,"5'10, 155"

917,Eric S.,30 Nov 2021,United States,4,Almost Perfect,"Lives up to the promise in my experience so far. The fabric has been super comfy throughout all kinds of weather. If I put this on, I usually won't take it off the whole ride unless the temps rise to 70-ish and the sun is shining bright. If I start building up heat, I just zip up the bottom zip. Zip down on the descent.

My main gripe is the fit. The shoulders fit sorta boxy and peak upward when I'm riding. That ends up shortening the sleeves which ride up behind my wrists. The construction leaves something to be desired at this price point I think. Seams are tidy, but not as confidence-inspiring as other jackets I've had around the same price.

933,jeff h.,22 Nov 2021,United States,5,"Form, fit and Function - Check","This jacket is exactly what I wanted. The fabric has a tremendous amount of stretch and wind resistance. It is also highly breathable as there is no laminate. Because of the weave (tightness) it is also quite wind resistant. Moisture repellent is adequate as it relies on treatment at the yarn or fiber level. Either way, moisture beads up and shed off the fabric. 

Fit is like a race fit lightweight LS long sleeve jersey. I use a LS base layer over the SS sleeve work jersey. There is still some room if I wanted a full thermal jersey underneath. The fit though is more jersey than jacket. Perfect for spring and fall weather where conditions change quickly and needs to pack down in key pocket when temps warm up. 

Dual zippers!!! Which means ultimate temp regulations without parachute affect or full unzip!

Pocket is easily accessible but not hearty pocket quick because of zipper. Ample room for phone, etc…

The pattern of the fabric is a great touch, not sure about the insulating factor because of how spaced it is, but it does add enough touch point to add a feel factor. It does feel great against the skin keeping any clammy feeling at bay without full laminated fleece. 

The color is definitely sage, the pics give it more of gray look, but it is sage.

I like it instead of arm warmers and a vest for early mornings--when you know it'll warm-up. It packs up reasonably small--it fits in a jersey pocket.

978,Paul,26 Oct 2021,United States,5,Micro Climate,"Have only gotten to use once, but looking forward to its heavy rotation. No back pockets so plan to use over a jersey. I put it on after a long and sweaty climb for a 25 mile drop of 5,000’. No flapping in the wind! and no shivers! I don’t live in a costal area with marine air, which may be its intended application, but if you ride up and down mountains this is a great addition. I am 42” at the chest and size Lg with many other kits, but Ornot sizing recommends Med and is perfect.

That early, it’s usually chilly out but only for the first few minutes. After a couple of miles, I’m regretting wearing my heavy old cycling jacket. 
Not. Any. More. 
I searched and searched and came across some reviews of The Micro Climate jacket from Ornot. It wasn’t cheap, but on par with what others charge for less superior trash bag garments. 
This jacket is perfect for 50 degree Bay Area mornings. The two way zipper is all I need when things warm up. In the afternoon, it packs away in my handlebar bag so easy!

I live in Asheville, NC, and so do a ton of climbing on my rides, often running into 5 - 10 degrees temperature variation just from elevation during a ride. This jacket helps keep me at my ideal temp throughout the whole thing. Pre-dawn rides that start out at 55 or so, end at 60 or so, and get down to the high 40's at the upper elevations are a dream with this jacket. I prefer a slightly looser fit so went with a large.

1017,Andrew L.,30 Sep 2021,United States,5,Fantastic Piece for Micro Climates or Just as a Jacket!,"As the name of the product suggests, this jacket is perfect for micro climates. I'm in the SF Bay Area and this jacket works perfectly for heading out the door on those relatively chilly mornings (mid-50s) where later on it might be a bit warmer (low to mid-60s). 

I typically wear mine with a Ornot House Jersey and a thin baselayer underneath. Despite this, the jacket is breathable enough that I don't overheat while climbing.

I was caught out in some light rain (first rain of the season) just after buying this jacket. With a light enough rain, the water just beads up on the surface of the jacket. However, it's important to note this jacket is NOT waterproof as stated by Ornot. Once enough moisture saturates the jacket, it'll start to wet out. The Magic Shell, which I intend to eventually order, will be much better suited for that.

Size wise, I wear a size small in Ornot's House Jerseys, which provides me a not too tight but not too loose fit. If anything it skews towards a tighter race fit, but still remains comfortable. For the Micro Climate Jacket, I initially ordered a size small which felt very roomy with only a jersey and baselayer underneath. Most notably, there was a lot of room in the shoulder and upper arm area. The material used on this jacket doesn't really flap in the wind, but I wanted something a bit tighter. I went to the Ornot store and the guy there was super helpful to convince me to size down to a Extra Small which fits way better. Excess material on the shoulder area has been cut down. Because of the stretchiness of the material, the body doesn't feel tight at all. If you intend to wear relatively light layers underneath (like a jersey and baselayer), I would recommend sizing down. If you intend to wear a heavier layer(s) and/or long sleeve jersey underneath, I would recommend sticking to your usual size.",3,Micro Climate Jacket - Stone Blue,Small,"5'6"" 135lbs"

But, although lean and as a lifelong surfer and swimmer, my shoulders can represent problems with fit. The narrow shoulder width made for a tight fit, so I returned it. Not ornot’s fault. The torso and arm length were perfect, though. Typically, Ornot, the materials and design are top notch. And Ben’s customer service is unparalleled and next level. Just super!

Before the Micro Climate, I would use my beloved Rapha Insulated Brevet, but I would always arrive at work with the liner dripping with sweat. With the Micro Climate over a short sleeve base layer and jersey (in temps around 60º-70ºF), I stay warm and arrive dry. It folds up so small that I can throw it in a jersey pocket and forget it's there. The material is amazing - unlike anything I've worn before. I often just keep it on for the first few hours of work just because it feels so good to wear.

1087,Warren H.,22 Jun 2021,Canada,4,"Great jacket, sleeves a tad too short.","This jacket is really nice. The material is nice against the skin, the insulation gives warmth without being stifling. It packs up quite small. My only ****** was with the fit. I originally ordered a medium because I wanted a bit more room for layering (I wear a small in the Ornot thermal long sleeve), but I found the body of the jacket to be a bit looser than what I wanted (though honestly not that loose). I exchanged it for a small and the fit of the body is great, nice and aero, but the sleeves are just a bit short on me. I'm going to keep the small, but it's a bit odd that the sleeves on this are short when the small thermal has sleeves that are a perfect length on the bike. Overall, really nice jacket and it will come in handy. Maybe the sleeves will stretch lol.",N/A,Micro Climate Jacket - Sage,Medium,N/A
1088,Spencer C.,10 Jun 2021,United States,5,I call it the magic climate jacket,"When my microclimate (MC) arrived, I was caught of guard by the petiteness of the packaging. About the size of a Castanza wallet, it was a noticeably small piece of kit that would be easily packable as advertised. I am often ambivalent about certain brand sizing and can be caught in between medium and large depending on brand. After reading reviews, I went with medium. Fit was perfect! I am 6’ and 168 lbs, with a muscular upper body. My first impression was the material seemed light and I questioned the noted temperature range. I love the lack of branding and another main reason I invest in the Ornot brand. Back to temperature: on my first ride, I took a leap and wore the MC over an Ornot thermal jersey with a non-sleeved base layer. My phone said it was 50 degrees at the start of 6 am ride pre-work ride, in coastal Santa Barbara. Throughout the ride the temp varied from 48-53. MC performed beautifully. Not cold at the start and not too hot as the ride progressed. I was impressed! Traditionally, I wear a gilet in this situation, so not having arm chill at ride start was nice. At the conclusion of the ride, the base layer was not damp, which demonstrates the breathabilty of the material. No flapping at an 18-21 mph pace with Max speeds in upper 20’s. I was able to access my phone in the rear pocket with full fingered gloved hands. I also appreciate the dual zipper upgrade. Overall, super impressed and suggest they change the name to the “magic climate” jacket, Ornot, as I also own the magic shell, but believe I will get more use out of this piece of kit in the situations I am most often encountering in the coastal and mountainous local rides.",3,Micro Climate Jacket - Sage,Medium,6’ 168

I live in MN and it seems to perform well when worn over short sleeve jersey in the 45-60 degree range for me. It breathes well and adds just enough warmth while riding in that temperature range. When the time comes to remove, the zippers are super friendly and allow removal while riding and it stuffs into the middle jersey pocket with no problems.

It is very comfortable to wear and extremely verstile.

It performed flawlessly and I love how it packs down. My only complaint is that it does seem to be a little big in the shoulders so when over the bars, it bunches up and flaps a bit. Due to the material, it isnt loud though. I thought I might be in between sizes but I went with the same size as my thermal jersey which is spot on.

The jacket looks great and feels well made. I'll be curious about durability and would be hesitant to take it on a trail ride as the fabric is relatively thin. 

The reason i'm giving it 4 stars vs. 5 is because the fit isn't quite perfect for me. I'm somewhat in between sizes with Ornot as the L vest I have is on the snug side (fortunately the material stretches) even though I prefer a more aero/race type fit and the XL is a bit too loose around my arms and midsection.

The garment's stretch is fantastic for all activities, including mountain biking and a quick ride down to the store, while it's water resistance helps for the misty morning excursions or when you get caught in a passing shower. The material is durable, comfortable, and provides a range of motion that allows for unrestricted movement not available in heavier jackets, but lacks the fragile feeling of lighter shells.

1232,Jeffrey C.,16 Dec 2020,United States,5,Best in Class!,"I've never been a fan of rain jackets, preferring to use a vest when wind was a factor, and avoiding riding when rain is in the forecast. With this Micro Climate jacket, however, my approach to riding in windy and sketchy forecast conditions has changed, especially given the fact the weather forecasts seem to have gotten less accurate the harder they try.

I love the breathability of this jacket. I am a heavy sweater, so to use this jacket and not have a build up of moisture after long, hard rides is saying a lot. I've ridden in this jacket in 45° temps with a LS base and thermal jersey up to 60° with a short sleeve jersey and have been very comfortable, with no overheating, and not being too chilly. My rides vary from 20 to 50 miles.

So, this jacket goes with me on every ride now, even if it's only stashed in my frame bag. I ride all winter here in West Virginia, and this has been a welcome addition to my fall/winter kit.

In future iterations I would love to see brighter color choices (orange is my favorite fall/winter color vs. hi-vis yellow) and a two-way zipper.

1241,Jose M.,14 Dec 2020,United States,5,when you need more than a vest,"On those rides when you can't decide between a vest with arm warmers and a wool baselayer or a long sleeve and base layer - this jacket solves the dilemma of not being stuck with either not enough or too much. It's the perfect weight with solid wind protection for days were the temps swing. I've used it on my last 3 rides in the Santa Monica Mountains. Starting ride temps in the mid 40's and finish temps in the mid 60's - the jacket breathes so well in that range that I never felt the need to take it off. It kept me comfortable.

I have to say I was very impressed. The little insulation triangles actually seemed to work and this breathed better than anything of the like I have ever worn. This really excelled when I zipped it all the way down for a climb and then all the way back up for a decent. For sure, the best value piece of winter kit I own.

Like everyone else has said, a bottom zipper would make this 5 stars. I would buy another one in a heart beat if there was a hi vis color and would also buy this as a vest.

1248,Naz H.,09 Dec 2020,United States,5,"Well, this changed my opinion on wind jackets...","Generally, I've never been into wind jackets. I love to layer and have become particular about what combo of layers I use to regulate temperature. Vests have long been my go-to, and the Ornot Magic Shell has been the perfect softshell-like jersey-jacket that brings you over the edge when you need to stay warm and protect from the elements. Between the two, I can layer down or up or do merino/poly or synthetic jersey combos with appropriate baselayers. I fell in love with the Powerwool thermal jerseys Ornot introduced last year, and prefer that jersey over the synthetic ones. The LS lightweight is a good jersey but I find myself a little cool in that one. I love the thermal jersey so much but that paired with a Magic Shell can be too toasty in the shoulder seasons. 

I live in San Francisco, so when I heard about this Micro Climate jacket and that Ornot is also based out of SF, I knew this would be interesting. So what did they do? They made a stretchy but absolutely fitted wind jacket that packs into its own pocket, and has little 1-2mm low-profile soft fleece pattern that matches their design on the inside that provides a touch of insulation and a lovely handfeel on your arms (if they're bare). I've now worn this jacket with the lightweight SS house jersey and my beloved thermal jersey and that 40-60º swing is easily managed. Bonus for the packability again, so if you do get toasty, you can stash it in a rear pocket or handlebar bag or strap it to your bike unlike the Magic Shell which while slim, is not as easily packable. You can bring this jacket along just for insurance. 

I wanted to give this 4.5 stars (but you can't with these reviews) because my only wish is a double zipper for heat management, but because I've now become a wind jacket convert, I'm down for the 5.",N/A,Micro Climate Jacket - Sage,,N/A

1250,dagbert,05 Dec 2020,United States,5,also magic,"Whoa, this fabric is the real deal. Super thin and stretchy, it's surprisingly warm and wind-resistant, but it doesn't stick to your skin when you warm up, or flap like crazy in the wind (you might be able to size down for this one for a more snug fit if you're not planning on layering with an LS jersey beneath). Oh, and the inside has this soft, textured pattern that keeps the jacket from sticking to your skin when you warm up, providing far better thermoregulation than I was expecting from a wind jacket. High-key brilliant, and a worthy contender to unseat the Magic Shell as my favorite piece of cycling gear in the closet. ",N/A,Micro Climate Jacket - Sage,,N/A

I’ve worn it with a jersey/base layer combo and stayed warm while descending in the Santa Barbara coastal mountains at about 48 degrees Fahrenheit. I have yet to test the water resistance, but I’d be willing to bet it works with as well as the other features do. Fit is great and stretchiness is perfect as it molds to your body.

1292,Charlie,09 Mar 2023,United States,5,Bossy Bibs,"These bibs are absolutely dialed. I wanted some bibs to really thrash this winter, and decided to try out the Ornots because they checked a lot of boxes — no ****** branding, good colors, cargo pockets, wool blend, straps don't go over nips. I got some mediums, which were suggested for my height and weight, but my thunder thighs barely fit. I swapped them for the larges — super easy, Ornot CS is dialed. The larges fit perfectly.

The construction is top notch. They are strong and cozy. I have ridden them on big gravel rides where they get completely saturated, but keep you warm. I have ridden them on mountain bike rides and crashed at higher speeds sliding over rocks and sticks, no rips or tears. I have also ridden them on chilly road rides where they also shine. These have seen trailwork days in the muck on hands and knees moving rocks and running chainsaws. We are talking about conditions from 28º and sunny to 33º and pouring. These things handle it all. If you know it's going to be REALLY cold, I would throw some shorts or pants over to help with some extra warmth, but for the most part these are amazing.

I have been riding 3-5 times a week this winter in these, washing them after each ride. They have held up insanely well. Most ""premium"" products start to show signs of wear when you wash them all the time — losing elasticity, fraying ends, stitching coming loose, like my pearl izumi gear. These are still as minty fresh as the day I bought them. They even do a good job of killing odors, thanks to the wool blend I would guess. Only problem is that they sold out before I could get my hands on the blue ones. :(

Anyway, if you are looking for bibs. Get these, they are insanely good.",N/A,Men's Thermal Cargo Bib Tight - Mesa,,N/A

1382,Ryan,28 Jun 2023,United States,5,Great Cargo Bib And Excellent Customer Service,"I am new to the world of cycling gear and bibs, and the staff at Ornot was extremely helpful. I went to their San Francisco location and was able to get all my questions answered by their staff. Everyone was very friendly and willing to go out of their way to assist. 

I tend to be in-between sizes and I often have trouble finding clothes that fit properly. I initially purchased an Extra Large bib. After trying the bib on at home and giving it some second thought, I realized it was too big for me. I contacted Ben in their Customer Service department and he was very helpful and responsive over email. I exchanged the bib for a Large; it fits great and is highly comfortable.

I prefer to buy from small businesses as opposed to larger companies, and I appreciate that they are a company that is climate neutral and is willing to put their money where their mouth is.",N/A,Men's Cargo Bib Short - Stone Blue,Extra Large,N/A

I'm 5'7"" 160lbs, so went with the mediums. These bib shorts are extremely comfortable, making medium and long rides a breeze. They are especially great for road rides but even better for gravel. The pockets are a fantastic addition and are very secure. I usually carry my phone on one side and then whatever else I need like fuel /snacks in the other. Not worried about stuff falling out.

I like the minimal styling and the color is great. Wouldn't turn down a slightly cushier chamois for long rides but maybe that's just my butt needing to toughen up, as the other reviewers seem to like it. No chafing issues and extremely comfortable.

1491,David R.,15 Feb 2023,United States,5,Beautifully Made,"I bought these bibs and a pair of Pactimo cargo bibs at the same time. Pactimo had a big sale and I thought I'd try both. Pactimo's bibs came first and they are quite nice. I'm a little concerned about the size and durability of their outer pockets. They basically stretch around about half the circumference of the leg. I'm not sure I like how loosely they hold items. The bib and chamois both seem to be well made and comfortable.

When I got the Ornot bibs, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the fabric used to make these. This is a high quality fabric. Second, the outer pockets, while not as large as those on Pactimo, are sturdy - and plenty large enough. Nothing is going to fall out of them!

I've only ridden in each once - both about 3 hour rides. They are both good. But I would say the Ornot chamois just feels like it is going to be comfortable for almost any length ride. I have the BWR AZ Wafer coming up in a couple weeks. At this point, I plan to ride on the Ornots. If something changes, I will update this review.

1497,Adam J.,13 Feb 2023,United States,4,Close but not perfect,"I really like the look and initial fit. Craftmanship not at the top of the spectrum, but matches the price point. The style of these bibs, like all of the ORNOT products, is ultimately why I bought them and appreciate them. Only used them for a couple fo rides so far, but my only real issue is the fit though front of the hips/groin. As time goes by on the ride, the fabric tends to bunch up in this area and start to constrict and rub. A smaller size is not an option as these were plenty tight. A bigger size would be too loose everywhere else and likely lead to more bunching. I've owned a lot of bibs and have never noticed this before. Hoping that this improves as they wear/break-in.",N/A,Men's Cargo Bib Short - Dark Olive,Medium,N/A
1498,Louis A.,30 Jan 2023,United States,5,2nd pair of the Cargos,"I also own the thermal cargo bibs, so I knew what to expect. The primary reason for buying these again was the chamois. It is very comfortable. The regular cargos are slightly more compressive than the thermals, I assume due to the material. Very pleased with my purchase, just FYI. I am 5'10, 150lbs and wear a size medium.",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Dark Olive,Medium,N/A
1499,Kyle H.,03 Jan 2023,United States,3,"Fantastic design and fit, bit exposed stitching makes these bibs less than perfect","I ride mostly gravel with a fair bit of that focused on fast bike packing and ultra endurance races. I purchased the Ornot Cargo Bib Shorts hoping to use them for that purpose. I've ridden about 1,000 kms in them over the past few weeks and here are some quick thoughts:

I really like the design and fit. The proportions of the size small are excellent for my body (5'10"" and 70kgs). The length and compression is spot on for my preferences. The pockets are well designed - right size and the band at the top provides security. Initially, the chamois seemed a bit thick compared to what I topically use, but I've found it very comfortable for long days >200kms on both rough and smooth roads.

My primary recommendation for improvement is in the stitching. The bibs are composed of many panels and the construction does not use flat lock stitching leaving quite a bit of material and stitches exposed in the interior of the bibs. This has caused chafing and discomfort, especially in the area between the front hip and the top of the quadricep where the material folds during pedal strokes. Removing the bibs left impressions and irritated skin in these areas. I have used chamois cream/butter to lesson the effects, but it's a less than ideal solution. I wasn't bothered by the other areas of the bibs where exposed material and stitching were present.

I hope that Ornot can address this in future iterations of the bibs, because there design has a lot of potential to be an excellent option for ultra endurance on/off-road riders.",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Black,Small,N/A

1506,Barakuder,14 Dec 2022,United States,5,Most comfortable bib I've tried,"Do not understand why anyone would ride in non-cargo bibs anymore. Just makes sense. Only pair of bibs I own that don't feel like they're slowly trying to cut off circulation between the legs. Straps do their job while letting you forget they're even there. Excellent pockets. Only non-positive comment is legs feel a little long when I first put them on but seem to adjust to a decent position once I get spinning.

1517,Don,22 Oct 2022,United States,3,"Pocket mesh, chamois could be better","I love Ornot’s mission and values, their product line always looks great, and I was excited to try my first pair of their bibs. Out of the package, the olive cargo bibs looked great. The green was even better than pictured. Sizing was spot on. They felt great on. The straps are amazing. 

On my second ride, however, the mesh of one of the leg pockets tore. I had stored my phone in the pocket, and the mesh fabric was not sturdy enough to handle my it (maybe stick with gloves or snacks for the pockets). 

After several uses, I’ve also found these bibs to chafe the inside-front of my thighs. The sides of the chamois toward the front have some flat fabric that extend much wider than the chamois fabric on all of my other bibs, and it’s this fabric that’s causes the chafing (even when using chamois cream). The rest of the chamois is really top notch. It’s too bad, though, because I really wanted to love these and round out my cycling wardrobe with some additional Ornot bibs.",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Dark Olive,Large,N/A

Despite doing a bunch of research on cargo bib offerings from other brands, I'm so glad I decided on these Ornot Cargo Bibs. Literally my first ride on them was on an organized century ride. The side pockets were extremely helpful during this ride, where I stashed the cue sheet on one pocket for quick and easy reference and some snacks on the other pocket. Zero discomfort from these during the entire 100+ miles and 6k+ ft elevation gain. Size-wise, they're on par with those from popular brands. I usually wear a size small in other brands and went with a small for these. They fit me quite well, although there are some things to note. First, the leg inseam is a tad longer than bibs from other brands, but there's enough give in the material to pull them up a bit and maintain those tan lines. Second, the bib straps are pretty long even though I have a long torso. No issues with them in the riding position, but they are loose when I'm off the bike (standing or sitting straight up). Not a showstopper, but hope Ornot takes this into account on the next iteration. The chamois is somewhat thick, but this is expected for an endurance bib.

I just spent $200 on some La Passione bibs and they weren’t the greatest quality nor did I like the fit. I also wear a lot of Rapha pro team bibs and they’re great. So when these came up I was hesitant to give them a shot because of my recent experience with La passione. However, I had a few friends that had these bibs and they came highly recommended so I took a chance and gave these a shot - I’m sure glad I did! I would highly recommend these bibs - they’re my new favorite bibs. Than you Ornot for making a quality product that’s made in California! Trust me you want to wear these bibs.",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Dark Olive,Medium,N/A
1615,Tucker D.,15 Jun 2022,United States,5,Great bibs,"Just after getting these bibs, I wore them on a 3-day gravel / trail bikepacking trip and they performed wonderfully.

1616,Brian S.,15 Jun 2022,United States,5,Favorite bibs so far,"Just completed 100 miles on gravel in these over the weekend and they worked really well.

I'm 6'0"", 180 lbs and the large fits just fine.",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Dark Olive,Large,N/A
1617,Forest,07 Jun 2022,United States,5,Fantastic bib - thicker padding works for me,"I had been sufferring with saddle sores brought on by a dip in a wet chamois. I rested for two weeks but still not much of an improvement, so I threw these bibs on for a 100 mile gravel ride. The padding is notably thicker than my Rapha Core chamois and it made a world of difference during the ride. The thicker padding provides a lot more comfort, especially on longer days. To top it off, the four stretch pockets are very convenient to store your snacks, phone, drink mix, wallet, etc. These bibs have just become my favorite pair.

1624,Ola S.,04 Jun 2022,United States,4,”More is more” maximalist pad,"These bibs are very comfortable and fit me well, but I have never in my life experienced such a thick/dense pad, and not sure I’m loving it… Other high quality endurance pads can start out feeling thin, but get more comfortable as the hours pass. This pad starts out feeling so thick that you don’t even feel the saddle, effectively changing your seat height, but then seems to compress as you ride. I have yet to take them on a really long ride, but suspect that they are going in the wrong direction.
Pockets are perfectly placed and work really well, straps are wide and soft, and very comfortable.
I’ll cautiously still recommend them, since this might improve after more washes, and I guess some people like really thick pads?",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Black,Small,N/A

I have only used it on one ride so I can't speak on anything apart from first impressions, but the cargo bib shorts are just as comfortable as the House shorts and I love love love that my phone doesn't get super hot like it would when I put it in my jersey pocket because air is constantly rushing over them.

The straps on these are absolutely incredible, so comfortable and soft. Length is slightly longer, and the chamois has a little more cushion, but beyond that the fit and feel are equivalent to the House Bibs that we're all obsessed with.

1669,Miles P.,05 Apr 2022,United States,5,Great bibs over long distances,"Great bibs indeed. The first thing I noticed when I got on the bike was how I couldn’t feel the seat. The firm chamois kept me floating above the hard seat in comfort. The medium fits my 6’1” 185lb self well, if quite snug (in a good way). The pockets are wonderful; the leg pockets are very stretchy but feel pretty tough, and the back pockets are quite high and out of the way for smaller precious things. 
My second ride on these was a 380 mile bikepacking race, so I pedaled in these for like 30 hours. No movement, no stretching out, no hotspots.

Had an R pair with good pockets that went to early body fabric failure + I was never 100% on the pad. A PI pair were a disaster in most ways, after several rides falling out of rotation and soon getting discarded. 7M makes an excellent pair, one of my go-tos for long unsupported rides, but unfortunate that without banding it can be tough to find the pocket entrances with full finger gloves.

I like the ornot brand, they are local to my area and do their best to keep everything local. That being said, I wasn't a big fan of their house bibs, I wasn't a fan of that chamois - it's fine. Just not for me. I took a chance with getting these as they state they redesigned their chamois. I after some good rides, I -really- like them. The only caveat I have is it feels like the straps are a bit long, they work - they just feel a tiny bit loose. They completely work, just different from the other walton-owned brand I use.

The chamois is thicker than most shorts I've used but it is very comfortable and doesn't feel bulky at all. I don't even notice the straps which is saying a lot because most bibs I've owned in the past, the straps were noticeable in a negative way.

The length took a little getting used to since I'm more accustomed to shorter bibs. The pockets were excellent. I had my phone in the side pocket and it felt secure. I took off my leg warmers mid ride and put them in the back pockets.,N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Dark Olive,Medium,N/A
1723,David E.,01 Feb 2022,United States,5,Why didn't someone think of this sooner?,"The Cargo Bib Shorts are a terrific idea - I love the idea of having minimal items in my jersey - or no items at all, if I am not wearing a bike jersey. So, I ordered a pair. Not only are the pockets great (I only use the ones in back generally), but the fit of the shorts is perfect, and the ""chamois"" pad is well made and comfortable. I generally wear size M in most bike clothing, but I went with a size S this time, based on recommendations from Ornot. The fit is snug, but I would not go with a M, as I think it would not be close fitting enough. I will be ordering more of these shorts in the future. And to think, I used to only buy Assos shorts, which are pretty darn nice also (but they don't have pockets...yet)",N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Black,Small,N/A

1725,Kyle M.,17 Jan 2022,United States,5,Quality Product,After owning two pairs of the ORNOT House Bibs I immediately purchased the cargo version when they were released. I hope the new straps make there way to the House Bibs because I much prefer the new design and materials. For anyone with the House Bibs the new endurance pad is about 50% more thick and twice as firm. It was marginally warmer to wear indoors on the turbo trainer with the pockets blocking a small amount of ventilation on their own and I'd imagine that only get worse when you start throwing food and gels into them. It's worth it to have the pockets for long rides though. I'm very glad to see they kept a minimal branding on this addition to their collection as well.,N/A,Cargo Bib Short - Black,Medium,N/A

1801,jeff h.,07 Mar 2022,United States,4,More than Pretty Ok,"I bought this to fill a gap. The thicker weight of the Polartec Powerwool stands out as a major plus. With the fiber blend you get anti stink, excellent moisture wicking and insulation properties with the added durability from the synthetic. Versatile in a wide range of temps is what I wanted and this fills that void. I am pairing this with a thin sleeveless or short sleeve base layer, but it has room for a long sleeve one as well when it’s much colder here in MN. The outer layer is either the magic shell or microclimate jacket. Both of which are superb and create one of the best clothing systems I have put together. My two complaints are the robust zipper garages and the rear pocket positioning. Zipper garage make it a pain to fully zip up after being completely unzipped to dump heat while still pedaling. The garage especially the bottom one is thick because of the fabric. Keep the top one but omit the button on next gen version. The biggest complaint is the high pockets on the back.

1809,Allan R.,11 Jan 2022,United States,5,"Great fit, better than previous version","This is my second one of these, and Ornot has improved the fit and function. The previous version had extremely long sleeves, to the point where it would bunch up quite a bit at the wrists. The sleeves are a better length on this version. Also the fit is a bit more fitted, as compared to the older version. The previous version wasn't loose, but this one is definitely more snug for a more streamlined look. Lastly, the zipper is a bit easier to use, the previous version had a zipper with smaller teeth that was a bit more ""sticky"", this one uses larger teeth and is easier to zip/unzip with one hand. The one change I'm not totally sold on is it seems the pockets are a bit smaller (size of opening). I haven't measured it, but it just feels a bit more difficult to put in and retrieve things from the pockets. Not impossible, and generally I prefer items in the pocket to be secure, rather than moving around, but they do seem a bit narrow. Performance is great, same as the previous version, keeps you warm but not overheated if the temps rise. Love the feel of this jersey!",2,Merino Thermal Jersey - Sage,Small,"5'9"", 65kg"

1815,Martin H.,16 Dec 2021,United States,5,Favorite Shirt for Bay Area/San Francisco,"I'm really happy with the material and thickness of the shirt. As a sweaty person I was worried the merino blend would be to warm for hill and harder cycling between 40-55 degrees, but it's been amazing. I never feel soaked as it wicks well, is very soft, and has a good amount of stretch. 

The fit is pretty trim, I'd say it's a race fit but the material is stretchy enough that it doesn't feel tight. 

5'7"" at 150lbs ordered a Medium (one size up from my usual as suggested)

My only complaints are that the sleeves are a bit long as I'm short, but all jersey's have this problem on me. The pocket could use a zipper and the pockets themselves could be bigger. 

One upgrade to consider is some sort of different thinner material on the pits for extra pit breathability. I have several other jersey's with this feature and it adds more range to the temperature functionality without making the shirt any colder.",3,Merino Thermal Jersey - Sage,Medium,"5'7"" 150lbs"

On its own, it's great in the 50F range, or down to the mid 30s with a base layer and vest. Interior is fuzzy and soft, and face is smooth and snag-free. My days of long winter base miles are well behind me, but this jersey has renewed my enthusiasm for bagging those late-season rides in the high country before the snow starts falling and the AT skis come out.

My only constructive criticism for Ornot is: make the sleeves a tad longer for us lanky folks so there's not a gap from glove to cuff, and consider jettisoning the folded fabric bit on the lower zipper; it doesn't add much value and makes it awkward to engage.

Note: I wear a small in Ornot SS and lightweight LS jerseys, and ordered a medium in this. It does indeed run a full size (or maybe a little more) on the small side, so order accordingly.",2,Merino Thermal Jersey - Sage,Medium,"5'11"", 143lb"

I was familiar with Polertec PowerWool so I was really interested to see how it worked in a jersey.I have been riding in mainly dry, cool/colder and windy conditions mainly in mornings when it starts out very cold and warms up. Here in Southern Cal that means mid 40's all the way up to low 60's along with around 50, cloudy and windy and a little damp. I have worn it solo, as well as with a sleeve less base and also with a wind vest. It performed supurbly on all those rides. The product wicks pretty darn good and retains its warmth but you don't overheat even up in the low 60's. The other thing that I love about this is that unlike wool, it is nice and stretchy but doesnt loose its shape so it fits right next to skin all the time. I am 5'11'' and 158 and the MED fits me perfect. It seems super tight when you put it on but once you are on the bike and moving around its perfect all the time.

1969,Naz H.,27 Dec 2019,United States,5,The perfect wool jersey (for me at least!),"I’ve tried a variety of wool jerseys over the decades - vintage ones, 100% wool, wool with acrylic, Sportwool, 60/40, 70/30, etc. This one is my favorite one to date because it allows a bit more room for layering (it’s relatively thin for a wool jersey, compared to say Rapha’s Brevet series), but also for cooling in case it does warm up more than anticipated. With a vest, and an appropriate base layer, the jersey definitely allows for a wide variance in temperature. On high tempo days, go a little lighter, and on slower slog days, go with a heavier base layer and more layers on top.

I’m impressed with the Polartec Powerwool this far. Definitely a fabric to watch. 

The fit is my favorite. Unlike some other jerseys, with saggy pockets, this is fitted close to the body in the lower back.

1991,Todd P.,22 Jun 2023,United States,5,Put it to the Test,"This is a top-notch all-weather jersey. Bought it ahead of a 2-day, 200-mile trip last November. Ended up a 1-day, 150-mile ride with a 30-degree temperature swing. 

If you’ve ever been to Georgia, you know the weather can be unpredictable in the fall. When we set out it was overcast and in the high 50s F. The day warmed to around 70F and I never overheated. Because the next day’s weather called for a near-freezing start and I forgot my tail bag (with my OrNot magic shell) back home, we called an audible and turned around at mile 75. 

That afternoon, temps dipped to low 40s and with only a too-big light rain shell over top I managed to stay warm so long as we were pedaling. Feel like I tested the full capabilities of this jersey. It breathes extremely well, but effectively traps heat such that a wind shell or gilet over top turns it into great insulation. Fit is close but not race, and I find a small fits me well (5’9”, 145-155lbs, 32” sleeves). Sleeves are not too long, unlike Rapha pro. Pockets are adequately deep without being hard to reach, and sturdy given the hardier material. Construction is good with no loose threads or missed stitches that I saw. 

I wear this when I don’t know what the weather will be. I also loan it out to friends who don’t ride regularly and don’t want to look or feel like a pretend pro. I wear Rapha Pro or OrNot, and choose OrNot for all my weather gear (outerwear, gloves, leg warmers, etc.).

It's lightweight and packable (check). The fabric blocks the wind and provides insulation (check). The vest is of a weight that doesn't flap around when you unzip to cool off (check). The material is stretchy so it hugs your body (check). It has pockets, so added storage that's easy to get at (check). It has a double zipper, so easy to regulate temperature and easy to get into your jersey pockets (check). Only nit pick would be the actual zippers are a little on the wimpy side for handling with gloves on. I have other vests, and the ORNOT vest is hands down more versatile and superior.

2058,Upcountry,30 Dec 2022,,5,Ornot know best...,"The Micro Climate Jacket was my introduction to Ornot two years ago, and I've since added a dozen or so pieces. I had actually emailed the crew last year with a request that they offer a ""Micro Climate Gilet"", and even back then they informed me that it was in the works. So the day this launched, I was on-board, even with being a bit caught offguard by the fabric choices. As Zviki mentions in their review, this isn't merely a sleeveless version of the Micro Climate Jacket, and thats the right move, despite me thinking that was what I wanted. 
A vest is typically an ""in-between"" piece for when the weather might not warrant a full jacket, but you need to cut a bit of wind over a jersey. The beauty of the combination of Micro Climate fabric and the grid fleece panels is that you don't give up too much in terms of wind blocking ability, and breathability, but you do gain the option of using this as an insulating layer under a shell. Thus making this piece just a bit bulkier than a pure wind gilet, but also far more versatile. I've owned a Polartec Alpha gilet from the big R, and this piece is really similar in its use, although I might say the Ornot will be warmer when used under a shell.
My only critique would be the color blocking/stitching on the Morocco isn't too appealing, but the Stone Blue is subtle and classy, and I've got no doubt other great colors will come in time.

2060,Zviki,28 Dec 2022,United States,5,As good as a vest can get,"I have the original microclimate jacket since it first came out, so was really excited about it, ordered as soon it was available. This is nothing like the jacket, though. The front is similar but the back has this fine breathable ""grid"" that feels so nice. Just picking it up, everything feels like premium quality. Tried it on a couple of rides now, 40-30s paired with a good base layer and a thin jersey. These were group rides, with plenty of effort to make me sweat. This vest is just outstanding. I didn't feel cold at any point, and I didn't feel like I'm getting drenched in there, either. When stopping, it evaporates quickly and was overly wet. Another great point is that the arms has nice elastic rubber that ensures they don't flap when descending, because nobody likes a flappy vest.

Packing it half way was simple, and it's small enough to fit in a jersey pocket. It does have itss own pockets and doesn't have the nice zippered pocket like the jacket. The pockets are nice and they feel like jersey pockets. I'm not sure I need them, since I normally like to option to take the vest off without stopping, and that won't work with stuff in the vest pockets. It's still nice to have, e.g. for a phone. If I had to think of something to improve: maybe add an opening on each side to allow easy access to the jersey pockets and have those zippered for venting when needed. 

Overall, this is an amazing vest. It's warm enough to work down to the freezing temps with a base layer, it's not bulky, it breaths really well, and I generally prefer a vest over a jacket, unless it's raining. I'm very happy with my purchase.",N/A,Micro Climate Vest - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

What really surprised me though is how warm this jersey is. Most of the reviews and descriptions talk about its breathability and how cool it is but I wore it for the first time yesterday on a 70º F fall evening and it was verging on being uncomfortably warm. The fabric felt more like a thin sweater than a performance cycling jersey, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but just wasn't expected. Also, like many others have stated, the sleeves are oddly loose... I have a larger upper body build than your typical cyclist and even on me (5' 11"" 167lbs) in size medium, they weren't baggy but not snug like my other jerseys.

I wanted something a little different than the House Jersey (which is excellent BTW) and took a chance on the Micro Grid Jersey. I was looking for more versatility so I could wear it while riding in a wide range of temperatures. I did my first ride with it yesterday and it was extremely hot and humid.

Works great on its own in the mid 50s (F) with a baselayer underneath or upper 40s to low 50s (F) when combined with the Micro Climate jacket on top. If you do decide to layer, it does get a little damp as you start to sweat as you're reducing the breathability with the jacket.

It was more than enough with a vest in the cold temps, and A-ok on its own in warmer temps and/or when climbing. It's truly a special piece, though definitely too heavy for anything above the 50's. It would be sweet if Ornot would offer another microgrid but even thinner for 50-60's. Even still, I'll probably end up buying another one of these.

I wear this jersey in rides in the 30s and 40s with a magic shell on the top and a base layer underneath, in the 50s with a base layer, and maybe up to low 60s with a minimal mesh base layer.

2201,Mark S.,11 Apr 2022,United States,5,Great Item for me,"This is essential a heavyweight thermal undergarment for colder weather riding. I have worn it three times with a short- sleeve jersey over top in the lower 40s to mid 50s. It provides some (not a lot) wind break, but certainly very breathable. I LOVE:
1. the weights and fabric - soft. clings nicely.
2. Zipper is excellent, even little tuck at bottom of zipper - quality touch.
3. The bottom has an excellent silicon/rubbery circumference and holds very well to my bibs so it doesn't hike up or move around when I do even over a several hour ride.
4. The color is unique, rich, awesome! Hook 'Em Horns!
5. It is a slightly cropped fit, which is perfect for me since I am a little short wasted. It does not stick out under a jersey or jacket on the bottom. A very neat look!

The sizing chart is excellent. I am 5' 10"" and about 205lbs. I ordered the XL to be a ""roomier"" fit. Wise choice. It is clingy and stretchy so really you cant go wrong ordering up a size unless you had narrow shoulders. Also, no matter the quality, and this is a very high quality piece, all jerseys will shrink a tad after a hundred washes, so that gives you some upside.

(just as an aside, I also got the micro climate yellow jacket. I ordered XXL - another wise choice. I can wear some thicker layers under it, as well as just a short sleeve jersey.)",3,Grid Thermal Jersey - Mars,Extra Large,"5' 10"" 205 LBS"

One caveat that doesn't detract from their overall rating is that even though these fit my waist well and as advertised, the fabric on these do stretch and sag slightly, especially when the pockets are full.

2297,Peter C.,28 Jun 2023,United States,5,"Probably the Perfect Pant, But Consider Going Up An Inseam Size","After being little underwhelmed by some competitors stuff (Mission Workshop, LuLu Lemon, Prana), I think these are about as good as it gets. The fabric weight is hefty enough to hold their waist, they're sewn in the US, and phone/leg pocket is really useful. The stretch is significant, the taper makes them easy to keep out of of the chainrings, and the zippers are robust. I bought two pairs and as long as I keep up with laundry I'm probably wearing them most days. I will promote what another reviewer said: consider going up a size in the inseam. I'm almost always a 32 inseam and these were breaking above my ankle bone. I'm not someone who likes a long hem for sure, but I'm used to that length breaking at the top of my foot.",N/A,Men's Mission Pants - Mesa,,N/A

Its rare for me to find a pair of pants that fit so well no belt is required. The fabric is a great weight. They are almost dressy. I would have zero concerns wearing these all day at work.

The rear pockets are very well angled, and I appreciate the extra mid-leg pocket too for storing more essentials. Can be a little dressy or casual as required.

Sizing aside, they great for commutes, airports and travel days, road trips. I’m actually taking these on an upcoming multi day backpacking trip since they’re so light and dry out quickly.

2324,Zach,22 Jun 2023,United States,5,Best pants ever,"I want to start this off by saying I'm very critical of pants thanks to having huge thighs and calves. If they fit one, they rarely fit the other (e.g. fits in the thighs, but now they're basically bellbottoms at the ankle), but a tear came to my eye that after literally searching for years I finally found some pants that fit perfect. 

I've put these pants through their paces, and they've held up beautifully. Everything from office commutes through terrible weater, a few trail rides through the countryside, and grabbing beers at the bar after, they've done it all in style. 

They offer plenty of mobility in the crotch, loads of pockets (huge fan of the zipper back back pocket to remove the anxiety of my work badge or wallet falling out), and they're breathable enough I'm willing to wear them out in the absolutely crushing summer heat in Texas. 

In addition to the use on the bike, they also look great off the bike and in casual settings. I'm not a huge fan of pants with a thigh pocket, but the one on these bad lads is discrete, and perfectly functional when on the bike. 

10/10 - highly recommend. I have a couple pairs in different colors, and will be slowly replacing pants in the wardrobe once other colors come back in stock.",N/A,Men's Mission Pants - Mesa,36x34,N/A

They look great, the zippered pockets are super handy, they've been durable to bike commuting and other wear-and-tear, they still look good after suffering some sweat and movement, and they're flexi through the thigh.

2389,Jeff B.,03 Apr 2023,United States,4,Very comfortable pants,"i really loved these pants as soon as i put them on. And for the next week, enough so that i ordered another pair. All was so good. Until i washed them.
i’m tall, and have quite a few pairs of pants that claim to be size 34 length. Unfortunately, this pair came up a little short after having washed them. FYI, i washed them in cold water and air dried. Still they shrunk. i’m still going to wear them because they’re so comfortable, but wish they came with another inch of length. i’m 6’-5; if you’re that height beware buying these pants.",N/A,Men's Mission Pants - Obsidian,36x34,N/A

2396,Jeff P.,31 Mar 2023,United States,5,Perfect but size down if you are between sizes,"As an owner of 5 pairs of Mission shorts you can imagine I waited a long time for these to happen… and it paid off. There really isn’t anything I would ask to be changed. The only thing I will mention is that if you are between sizes (like me: 31 waist) size down! Also, I’m 6 ft even and 32 inseam. Based on expert Ornot advice I went w 34 length. I would put the length of 34s more on par w other 32 pants I’ve owned.",N/A,Mission Pants - Slate,32x34,N/A
2397,Jon S.,30 Mar 2023,United States,5,Another win,"What can i say, i put them on and they feel fantastic and wearing them right now. They look great. Feel great. Move well.

2398,Lucio M.,29 Mar 2023,United States,5,Super good pants,I’ve had a pair of mission workshop pants for 6 years that I love and have wanted a second pair for years but they’re pricey.

2406,Jeff C.,29 Mar 2023,United States,5,Good quality,I’m a fan of the mission shorts and figured I’d mix in a pair of long pants. These do not disappoint.

2417,Nicholas M.,27 Mar 2023,United States,5,the best shorts are now the best pants,"I already owned several pairs of mission shorts that I wear the majority of the year so I was stoked to try out the new mission pants. They are everything I hoped they would be and more! I have been wearing them everywhere: around the house, on the bike, to the store, and to the office which was the one place I couldn't get away with wearing the shorts. I have been wearing them so much that my wife already ordered me another pair. They are super comfortable, very durable, and very nice looking pants.

They work great on the bike, and I really like the reflective sticker inside the leg tubes that can help with making sure I make it home on my commute from the office. 

More importantly (at least to me) is that these work great even off the bike. The 5th secret pocket zipper is discrete enough where I don't feel out of place in a social setting after work.
