509,Sean A.,18-Aug-21,United States,5,Max Sock - Kit staple,"These socks are a staple of my kit; they are comfortable and after a summer of riding I’ve found them to be a great hot day alternative to my treasured merino Ornot socks. 

I especially like the fit and compression. Unlike some other socks that slip on the heel these hold well on the foot and at the ankle, without being too tight. I use my pair at least one ride a week and there hasn’t been any issues from multiple wash cycles, no pilling, and no holes in the heel or toe even though I often use these trail running as well.

$16 for a pair of socks may seem pricey, but for a piece of kit I use far more frequently than cheaper socks from other brands, the investment paid off. I’m happy to support Ornot products as they are from an ethical company and they perform great!",N/A,Max Sock - Drk,Large,N/A

523,Michael G.,6-Oct-20,United States,5,Max Sock “to the max”,"Being a cyclist riding road, mountain, abs gravel I am particular about foot comfort and enduring performance. 

I need my socks to be simple to put in my feet, first and foremost. My thumbs and ligaments suffer from De Quervain's tenosynovitis which is quite painful pulling cycling socks on linearly. The Ornot Max Sock is flexible yet retains its elasticity and keeps it form upon pulling it on in place to hook up on the heel without yanking on my painful thumbs. To some this may seem inconsequential but to me it is the beginning of each ride — gearing up is a process. 
While secured in my nice shoes (I wear two different manufacturer’s shoes in road, gravel, mtb) these sweet, sweat wicking socks stay dry and in place. There are no bulges in the toe corners and no pinching or sliding. 
I live and ride in south Florida. Unlike the Rocky Mountains where my roots began, south Florida has many odd plants and grasses that “stick” to socks - though, not on these socks!! 
Cleaning them is simple and I simply hang dry them over a clean top tube. 
The Ornot Max Sock is the ideal, sick cycling sock!!
