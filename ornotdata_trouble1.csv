There's no shortage of egregiously-priced athletic-ish shorts out there making grand promises, and while I haven't tried them all, these at least seem to live up to the hype. No regrets about the high price point — hope they last for many years.

Honestly, I didn't realize these were the light version when I ordered them, but they are still great.

These new shorts fit just as good as the old short, but the stretch material is something to behold. I did not have a problem riding or being active in the old short, although these new ones just flow and bend so smoothly that not noticing you're wearing them while commuting/climbing/doing sweet karate moves is what it's all about. 10/10 - highly recommend.",N/A,Lightweight Mission Short - Stone Blue,30,N/A
82,Charles J.,16 Oct 2022,United States,5,"The best casual cycling shorts I've tried, even with a few nits.","After eyeing up the Mission Shorts for awhile, I finally went to hit ""Purchase"", only to be pleasantly surprised that Ornot had just released the Lightweight version! I was actually a bit reluctant to order the original version, as other friends and reviews had mentioned that the material can be a bit thick and the shorts can get hot, so it was perfect timing.

After wearing them for a few weeks, I am very, very, very happy with these shorts. I am normally a swrve guy, having owned multiple pairs of pants, trousers, knickers, and most recently, their Transverse lightweight shorts. I really love swrve stuff, but their sizing and cuts can be a bit inconsistent, leading to some low waists, high crotches, and tight thighs. Plus, I was really excited to find that Ornot's stuff is still being made in the US!

Compared to the best-fitting stuff I have from swrve, which fits me pretty well, these Lightweight Mission Shorts fit me *perfectly*, and are even more lightweight. I usually am a 30"" in virtually all other brands, and also took a tape measure to myself and other pairs of shorts. I found the slightly generous ""16in for a 30"" waist"" sizing and cut to be very comfortable, allowing me to wear them slightly above the hips for a 'normal-rise' fit without causing any crotch tightness or discomfort. The material is surprisingly lightweight. The thighs are very comfortable and leave good room for me without looking baggy at all. For real, you don't realize how poorly other shorts fit you until you put a pair of these on.

Things I love:
- The high waisted cut.
- The flat edge of the pocket is along the outside of the thigh, so that things feel very secure (as opposed to the flat edge being along the front of the thigh).
- I really appreciate the reinforced belt loop for keys.
- The slash pockets as opposed to jean-style pockets.

Minor nits:
- The 8.5"" inseam is noticeably shorter for me than the 9"" on my swrve. Be prepared to show some leg while pedaling!
- The front pockets could use a bit more finishing. There is only one stitch at the seam of the pocket, but while riding, the inside material of the pocket tends to want to flip and bunch outwards, creating a kind of awkward billow. It's very subtle, but enough to bother me.
- No reflectivity. Give me some reflective belt loops like swrve! Or even a subtle thing like a reflective Ornot tag along one of the legs instead of the non-reflective logo tag.
- I'm not crazy about the angled back pockets. They seem to knock something that would have otherwise passed as 'normal' clothing into an 'athletic-y, not-so-casual' item.
- On my swrve shorts, the zip pocket is the rear left, and the rear right is open. I like this configuration because I put my wallet in the left and tuck keys into the right. On these Ornot shorts, the open side is left and the zipper is right, leading to an unsecured wallet and over-secured/hard to access keys. I recognize this is a personal thing, but wish it either matched my swrve shorts or were both just zippered.

All the above being said, these shorts are a 4.75 out of 5 for me. These shorts very quickly kicked out my swrve Transverse as my daily-driver short. I just wish I could afford more pairs in more colors! I'll also now consider getting a pair of the regular-weight shorts for the transition seasons. Really great purchase overall.",N/A,Lightweight Mission Short - Slate,30,N/A
83,Ryan D.,16 Oct 2022,United States,5,Super Light,The first thing I thought when I put these on was that these are going to feel amazing on the trail.

90,Michael O.,12 Oct 2022,United States,5,Lightweight mission short in stone blue,"These are my fourth pair of mission shorts, and for good reason. I love the lighter weight and thinner material. Absolutely, great for warmer days and activities that heat you up, like running. I’ve put mine through the ringer. Cycling, running, gym/weight training and fast day hikes. I’m 5’8” and 156 lbs. and medium/32 waist fits me perfectly. My last 3 pair, are consistent in size. But, my first ran a little bigger, but work great with a padded undershort for long rides. I’ve worn the typical lycra, cyclist garb for 30 years and am tired of that look. It’s nice that Ornot has quality, performance pieces with an understated look, and zero sacrifice in usability.

91,Matt B.,12 Oct 2022,United States,4,"Lighter than the original, a little swishy","I have pretty much every color of the original Mission Shorts and absolutely love them, so I was not mad to see an even lighter weight version. The fit is similar and the material is decidedly thinner. I haven't had a chance to wear these anywhere hot yet, so I can't say how they compare for that, probably making this review useless overall. The biggest con so far is that the material is kind of a ""hard"" swishy tech fabric, so the pants are kind of loud. I'm going to wear them for stuff like hiking, gardening, chores around town - but probably less inclined to go out for dinner in em, because of the obvious tech-ness of the material.",N/A,Lightweight Mission Short - Stone Blue,30,N/A

117,Geoffrey B.,28 Jun 2023,United States,5,Love these bibs!,"I own a few pieces of cold weather gear from Ornot but I live and ride in the desert and these bibs are perfect- with lightweight, breathable back and suspenders, and with the option of colors other than black, I stay as cool as possible. The grippers work and the shammy sham sham is the perfect thickness. It’s obvious that these bibs (and all Ornot gear) are designed and built by actual riders. 
Add to that a chill aesthetic from a conscious company who’s actually trying to make a difference? Sold. I will definitely buy more of these bibs to keep in the rotation.

Super chamois that is properly situated. Great bib color. I was amazed at how light and soft they feel. I do have big legs and over time and many rides the elastic in the legs have tired a bit. I chalk that up to big legs, wear and tear, yet I still wear them. Plus, from the get go they never binded my legs as others have, so no complaint, just informing.

159,Erik,09 Apr 2023,United States,5,Very Good,"I like these bibs a lot. Yes - the chamois is on the thinner side. For me, that’s a good thing. I don’t like thick pads that press against things you don’t want them to press against. I find this chamois does a great job disappearing once you’re on the bike. And yes - the chamois sort of sticks out a little in the back when you’re off the bike. But so do other $300+ bibs from other brands. I care about what it does on the bike; not when I’m standing around. 

Also yes - the bib straps are kind of thin. I do wish they were thicker. But again - I don’t personally notice it at all once I am riding. They didn’t bother me. 

I really like material overall. It’s thin in a good way and feels very light and comfortable and stretchy on the skin. 

I bought the slate color and like it a lot. It’s very solidly gray and has a little shine on the leg grippers. I really like the slight texture/patterned appearance of the bibs also. 

I am between 6’0 and 6’1 and about 170 lbs. I bought a Large and I will say these fit looser than size Large I have from some other brands. The straps are looser, which is probably a good thing for most people. They don’t pull down your shoulders. I probably could easily go with a medium. If you’re about my size and you like your bibs tighter, I would go medium.

Overall - these look great and I was impressed with how much they disappeared while riding.",N/A,Men's House Bib Short - Slate,Large,N/A

340,Michael B.,03 Sep 2021,United States,5,Now a Favorite!,"I own and have owned a lot of different premium bib shorts and I think these strike the best balance of features and price. Great compression (though ordered a size down...more later), killer color (photos don't really do them justice), and most importantly a great pad/chamois. To me a good chamois is a make it or break it deal. These are definitely a make it. 

The Elastic Interface pad strikes a real Goldie Locks balance. Supportive, but not too thick (can't stand a thick chamois), and just the right density for a few hours of riding. I'm also not a big fan of super dense pads...they tend to make me feel numb after a while. So bravo Ornot on pad selection. 

Size: I'm sort of on the cusp of an XS and Small...leaning towards Small. I'm 5'10"" (all torso), 145lbs, 30"" waist, and have fairly lean climber-ish thighs. I prefer a racier cut/fit. I originally ordered a Small but felt like I might swimming around in the crotch a bit...no bueno. So after a little guidance from customer service, I got them swapped for an XS and am super happy with the fit. Hope that maybe helps someone else. 

Overall, I'd give these two thumbs up on price, fit and comfort. I grab these bibs more often than any of my others now.

Comfortable, chamois held up over ~6.5 hours. The silicone-free leg grippers are super comfortable and don't irritate my skin, which I find happens on longer rides when wearing bibs with silicone grippers.

 I now have 4 Ornot items (an older lightweight Long sleeve jersey, which is an inch too short for my very long arms,and a vest) and will have a fifth when the Stone Vest is again available in Large.

The Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color, good but not superb fit, let down just a tad by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. 
Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (may be due to my height and needing a Medium) Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are better

Also:
- the House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic fit, finish and look, with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length).",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Mesa,Large,N/A

512,David G.,01 Mar 2021,United States,5,"Excellent fit, durable","Goes without saying the lack of lettering and logos is good. Bought 4 of these a couple of years ago, and I conservatively estimate I put about 100 hours in each pair. Happy to report they're still in good shape -- not a single stich has come loose or undone, unlike a few Italian name brand bibs I've used. Initial feel was stiff, and while they're still holding their shape, they've softened up some. The fabric is showing no obvious signs of wear, though it might be thinning after so many uses and washes. About a year ago I noticed two of the bibs had a tiny amount of the chamois coming through the stitching; I was afraid it was the beginning of an unraveling, but it hasn't gotten worse and I've ignored it. I've worn knee warmers in the winters, and the leg grippers have not loosened from the extra width underneath. I was worried about how much money I was risking on shorts that might not hold up, but they've exceeded my expectations.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,,N/A

I find many bibs are simply too short and ride up to that mid-thigh position after a while in the saddle - that 'hot-pants' look that you really don't want to be rocking! These are cut long enough and the silicone grippers are snug enough that they stay in the right spot, a couple inches above the knee. The pad is comfortable and the suspenders are long, wide and soft enough to be comfortable on the shoulders. Great product at a sensible price - and locally made to boot!

530,Daniel H.,02 Feb 2021,United States,4,Great Value,"The House Bib Shorts exhibit a great value for the cost. Compared to my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts ($229 Retail), the House bib's pad isn't quite as comfortable, but IT IS much more comfortable than the cheaper bibs I own and very comparable to other expensive bibs such as the Giordana FR-C bibshorts ($250 Retail). I also found the compression to be similar to the more expensive Giordana Bib Shorts. One place I feel like these bibs could really improve is in the straps. They're not bad by any means, but they're also nothing special. The straps are similar to much cheaper bibs I own and compared to the straps on my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts, they're definitely a step down. The straps on my Velocio bibs just feel much more comfortable and luxurious. As for size, these bibs are spot on. I often border on the line between Medium and Large, and upon reaching out to customer service, they advised me to order the Medium. They are compressive, but not too tight, and overall fit great. For reference, I am 5'7""-5'8"" and 170ish lbs. I decided to give these 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like there's room for improvement, but they are a great value. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

565,Kyle,09 Jan 2021,United States,5,Color is slightly different than website photos.,"Just got my bibs in the mail and love the fit and quality of them. My only issue is the color being a much lighter grey than I expected. I would say they are more of a medium grey while they look nearly black on my Macbook's display. I understand that displays are very different in their color profiles so I won't dock ORNOT on that in the slightest. What I didn't expect were the white bib straps. Not a huge deal but many bibs color match the straps. I understand that it is more cost-effective to have one set of straps for all of the bibs they produce. In hindsight looking at all of the other house bibs the straps are white but it wasn't shown in any photos on this listing as the one photo is could have the wearer has his arms crossed covering the straps. 

Please update the photos on the slate house bibs to include the bib shoulder straps. This would also highlight the very breathable mesh on the bibs that is very comfortable. I also think one photo with all three color options stacked/fanned out would help show the colors better. Referred to the company by The Gravel Ride Podcast. No regrets about my purchase - might have gotten the obsidian in retrospect though.",N/A,House Bib Short - Slate,Medium,N/A

LIKES:
-The chamois is pretty thin compared to other brands. This may be preferable to some, but I'm guessing it was chosen to keep the price down.

Fabric is more robust for high humid temps, but these are a workhorse pair of bids for all other days. EIT makes some of the best pads and this is a mid level pad, but still plenty comfy. Seems pretty good for up to 5 hr rides maybe slightly more, but I like thicker pads. Max so far has been a more than a few 4 hrs and still solid. Highly recommend these bibs for everyday use.

675,Christian M.,19 Aug 2020,United States,5,"Great bibs, great repair service too!","My introduction to Ornot came two years ago when a friend gave me an already well used jersey and pair of house bib shorts. I loved them right away, and started reaching for them earlier and earlier in the clean/dirty, ridden/unridden laundry cycle until they were clear favorites, in particular the bibs. I sized up to a medium from small for this purchase (5’10”, 155lbs,) and they’re very comfortable. At my size and stature both small and mediums work, it’s just a question of how much compression I want on any given day. For this one I went medium because at the age of 42, I’m unlikely to be shedding any more weight... Anyway, I tested them on one short evening ride, and then wore them for a 160 mile, 13k’ day-long ride with nary a bit of discomfort. They’re great bibs.

Regarding Ornot service: I bought a Magic Shell jacket that I also love, but some stitching began to show premature wear. I sent an email, and got a return label right away. The repair was completed and the jacket returned to me within a matter of four or five days. I can’t ask for more than that! ",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,Medium,N/A

The chamois feels pretty good, but is a bit thin. One thing I do not like is that there appears to be too much material on the front of the crotch area, which causes me to have a ""moose knuckle"" when standing. In addition, this causes the fabric to bunch up when riding and move a lot. It doesn't appear to impact anything, but I could see it wearing out the fabric faster than normal, since it isn't taut in that area.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

809,Andi,10 Jun 2020,,5,"Excellent overall, one little ******","I am always unsure about sizing for kit. What the guides don't tell you is, for your measurements, just how tight/compressive or stretchy the article is supposed to fit/feel. I find Rapha and Assos bib shorts to be made of a more stretchy material (and even then I size up from M to L). My Castelli bibs are less-stretchy, so the fit for my size feels tighter. As it turns out, these Ornot bibs are on the compressive/tight side. By that I mean the material doesn't stretch as far. So it's a tad harder to pull these on. Once they are on, they feel really good. Not binding, not tight. 

I'm 5'9"", 158lbs,;I ordered Medium (with some trepidation), but I'm glad I didn't size up. These fit spot-on, and there's no odd looseness or flaring around the leg openings.
The one ****** is that there's a little excess bulk at the front of the pad, so when riding out of the saddle I can feel that bulk at the front shifting side to side (my inner thigh that's at the top of the pedal stroke pushes the pad away, and then my other inner thigh comes up and pushes the pad back the other way). >--hope that makes sense! 

I love Ornot's color palette. Was looking for navy shorts but this Stone Blue is unique and looks great!",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Stone Blue,Medium,N/A

I don't usually write reviews for contact point items because I think comfort/discomfort comes down to a decent bike fit but these bibs will treat you well if you're pretty comfortable on the bike otherwise. The pad has a lower profile and is more firm than some of the thicker, more plush pads on some of my pricier bibs but I'm satisfied with my experience, especially for the price.

I'm a 31 waste and bought a small, they've definitely got a compressed fit and I almost thought there was no way I'd fit in them but once you pull them up they're perfect.
Chamois is comfortable where they need to be without a huge pad squashing your nuts (not sure why any shorts need to have that and so glad these don't)

Wide minimalist leg grippers do the trick. Fit is spot on (medium for my 5'9"" 160lbs). Paired with my Gray Line House Jersey I'm as fast as ever! Minimal branding is super cool. I don't get paid to wear my kits so I feel strongly about not giving the brands I wear free advertising. Ornot gets that and I appreciate it!

1170,David G.,13 Mar 2019,United States,4,Potentially rad,"My ultimate basis for judging bibs is longevity: of the seams, the chamois, and especially the fabric. So a couple of hundred miles isn't nearly enough to judge longevity, and given that I bought enough to rotate them each for a ride a week, I hope that I get a couple of years out of them (about 100 rides). 

That said, the fabric is promising. It seems very sturdy, and feels different from the very stretchy feel of the Castellis and Giordanas I've been using and haven't gotten enough life out of. No issues at all with comfort after several hours in the saddle.

Couple of criticisms: the inseam is somewhat short. Maybe I'm dating myself here, but I much prefer the classic fit of bibs, where the gripper would reach a couple of inches from the knee. Nowadays it seems the typical fit is nearly halfway up the thigh, and the House bibs, while not that bad, could be longer. Also, the cut in the front is high, and combined with the stiff construction, makes peeing a challenge; maybe that will loosen up in time.",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,,N/A

1204,Thomas M.,15 Sep 2018,United States,5,My Favorite Shorts,"I’ve owned Ornot’s colder weather weight bib shorts since last fall - I quickly realized that they were also my most comfortable. So I continued wearing them even in the warmer weather all year, despite the thermal nature of the fabric. I kept looking to get a summer weight version, but the online store always seemed to be sold out. I finally got a pair this month, and I can attest that the new ones are just as kind to my underparts as the old ones are. Your green pad rules! That combined with great customer service has made me an Ornot fan for life. The handlebar bag is perfect for the long rides. And your socks... Let’s just say they attract a lot of attention. My best story - passing a group of lady riders I got told off for not shouting, “On your right!”, before I overhauled them, then nanoseconds later came the comment - “Oh I guess you thought that wearing socks like those you didn’t need to!”",N/A,House Bib Shorts - Black,,N/A

Easy to walk in, ride in, not baggy, on the shorter side. However, the biggest issue is the button hole stitching has come apart on the top and makes it difficult to button as the button sometimes go through the stitching and gets caught.

1287,PDXMatt,23 Jun 2023,United States,4,Perfect leg length and taper,"I liked these shorts enough to but in three different colors. I usually wear a 33 waist and they don't have a 33. So my first pair was a 34, which was big enough that I need a belt. However, the belt loop material sags a bit with most heavier belts, so it's hard to really get them to cinch. The 32 was actually perfect. So if you're in between like me, size down. The inseam and length is perfect for me. Very flattering on the legs. Not too long or too short. I'm 6', 195 lbs. I would give 5 stars were it not for two issues: the crotch and the pockets. The crotch has a lot of seams going on and can be uncomfortable walking around, especially in the summer when sweating. The pockets are very thin and walking around with a phone, wallet, or keys in them is very uncomfortable. Whatever you have in them will just scratch up against your skin. For this price point, a more robust pocket should be used. Otherwise I have had trouble finding shorts that fit this well and have received several complements on them.",N/A,Men's Mission Short - Obsidian,32,N/A

My wife calls them my trim-fit ""euro"" shorts (as a compliment). The weight, length, durability and design are pretty much spot-on. My only issue is with the leg opening size. It's about 1/2"" too narrow for bike racer thighs. When I sit down in them, the legs tend to bunch up and get stuck up on my mid-thigh because of it (and maybe the material).

The height between the crotch and the back of the shorts was very short and would have sported quite the plumbers crack had I hopped on a bike.

1393,Peter N.,30 Aug 2022,United States,5,Great!,Very nice shorts. Fit is great with room in the waist but slimmer on the legs. The fabric is very nice and feels high quality.,N/A,Mission Short - Mesa,38,N/A
1394,Alexander K.,30 Aug 2022,United States,5,Current favorites from a shorts enthusiast,"I'm very particular about my shorts and constantly on the hunt for the perfect pair -- prefer a shorter inseam, tighter fitting, durable but stretchy without looking like athletic shorts. For hike/bike, I've tried everything from Patagonia, Topo, canvas Bear Bottoms, Crust, Vuori, Swrve, Ripton (current favorite, wish they made chinos). These may have eclipsed Ripton as my favorite outdoor hike, bike shorts. Super clean looking, plenty of stretch, no weird bunching or pinching, light and dry quick, and my biggest pet peeve, they have a normal amount of rise so it doesn't mash your junk. These guys are expensive but off of a few wears, seem like a good value. Will order more and would love to see more color variety.

FWIW, I'm 5' 8"", 155 and typically wear a 28"" to 29"" waist and sometimes 30"" depending on cut. I bought a 28"" in these because of the stretch and I like a tighter fit for biking. Fit great but pockets are pulling a little.",N/A,Mission Short - Olive,28,N/A

These have quickly became my favorite. Most comfortable shorts I’ve worn on a bike, and feel just as good off of one. I’m a 33 waist in real inches. The 32 are a little snug but the fabric has enough give to fit well. Don’t know that a 33 wouldn’t feel too big all things equal, and would almost for sure need a belt if I went with 34, which I wouldn’t want to wear with these.

1419,Efrem S.,19 Aug 2022,United States,4,"Great Fit, but something is missing.","I've searched far and wide for a short that feels, fits and moves this well. I am looking forward to its longevity. But with all that in mind, I am a little worried about the material and its ability to hold up during the summer months. It does not hold moisture well. It does the job.

1420,Joshua N.,18 Aug 2022,United States,4,"please do 33"" waist","I'm 6', 190 lbs, and usually 33"" waist size. Since this brand doesn't offer 33"", I sized up. First bought the gray in 34"". I definitely needed a belt for them, but the leg length and width was perfect. I then ordered black and olive in 32"" hoping they would fit a little better. The waist was a better fit for me, not too small, stretchy, however much smaller dimensions otherwise. The legs were shorter and tighter, too tight. I much preferred the leg dimensions of the 34"". I was surprised at the difference but the 34"" fit me so well in the leg that I exchanged the 32""s for 34""s. So I now have in all three colors, but just need to wear with a belt. A navy blue would be nice in these. I will say the pocket material is a very thin mesh, and having items in them is not comfortable while walking. Fine for cycling, but items like phones and keys poke through those pockets. The outer material is great. Just enough stretch and seems sturdy and resilient.

1430,Max W.,28 Jul 2022,United States,5,New Favorite Shorts,"I’ve been on a quest for new shorts to for several months now and these are the answer. I often have a problem with shorts where they are too tight in the thigh and too loose around the hips which makes the legs awkwardly ride up, but the fit and stretch of these is perfect. They look much smarter than your standard outdoor/hiking shorts, and the material seems sturdy and durable. I exclusively wear bibs for long rides so I can’t speak to how they hold up for “serious” cycling, but off the bike I’ve barely taken them off since I got them, and they’ve been superbly comfortable for quick rides around town. My only (minor) complaint is the lack of a small pocket for keys, change, etc. One of the back pockets is zippered, but it’s full size which means you’re sitting on your keys if you put them there. A smaller pocket within or above the front pockets (like the change pocket on a pair of jeans) or a small zippered pocket on the leg would help a lot.

1439,Matthew M.,21 Jul 2022,United States,5,Excellent all-purpose shorts,"I’ve been using these shorts for a few weeks for virtually everything including hiking, cycling, casual walks, and lounging. I opted for size 32 (I’m a ~33 waist and decided to size down instead of up). I prefer having them fit a little tight (they have stretch anyways) to having them too loose. The shorts have a slim cut but look great and the feedback I’ve gotten is that they suit me well. The mesa color is nice too. The 8” inseam is recommended if you prefer a cut above the knees. The shorts are made of nylon and seem insanely durable, but they also provide a nice enough amount of stretch to be comfortable on a bike.

1473,Lance,22 Jun 2022,United States,4,"Great shorts, but","I bought these shorts in early 2021 and they quickly became my go-to shorts. I recently ordered a couple more pairs since they were back in stock and they just weren't the same as the original pairs I own. The leg opening was tighter and made these fit more like tights than shorts and the pocket opening is so small it's difficult to get my hand in /out. I wear a 28 and am average build so it's not that I have abnormally large thighs. After looking at how the shorts fit in the photos on the website (a finger or two of room at the leg opening), I'm starting to think that as you get to the smaller sizes, the proportions are slightly off. I tried a size 30 thinking that maybe I am actually a size larger, but they weren't even close to fitting in the waist. Again, I love these shorts and do plan on trying them again, but would love to see a little looser leg opening on future iterations.

1474,Matt G.,21 Jun 2022,United States,2,Leaning more towards Not,"Was really hoping to love these shorts due to their very strong reviews, seemingly great material and simple cut. Turns out, the fit is very wonky and as a result, they’re not very comfortable to ride in (mostly using them as summer commuting shorts). First, the waist: I’d really love if Ornot would make some changes here, mostly in offering some odd-numbered waist sizes (namely 31). The 32 is rather roomy on me, but I’m sure the 30 would be too snug elsewhere. A belt works ok here, but due to the thin nature of the materials, can cause some bunching. I’d also love to see the addition of a key loop or something (not just belt loops). The rise (or something): Immediately upon putting these shorts on, things start to bunch up in the nethers. I’m not entirely sure what the culprit is, but it’s very annoying. Rise too short? Is the interior fabric too textured and starts bunching up yer undies? Not sure, but whatever it is, it’s uncomfortable. The worst part, the leg openings: Simply put, they’re too small. I get we all want to show off our glistening tree trunks for legs (of which mine actually aren't), but the small leg openings cause these to ride up significantly when riding. I find myself constantly trying to pull them down while on the bike. Couple that with the aforementioned issues of the rise, and you get a pretty uncomfortable ride. Oh, and forget about wearing them in the heat and humidity of the midwest too; all of the above bunching issues just get worse.

1501,adam m.,10 Jun 2022,United States,5,Amazing shorts!,"This is my second pair of Mission shorts. I absolutely love them. They are the perfect casual shorts and even better riding shorts. 
My only qualm is that they have a different fit. My olive shorts have a little looser leg room and are about an inch or so above the knee. My new obsidian shorts are very slim through the leg and longer, right at the knee cap. I definitely like the fit of my olive ones better.

A+ Product","I have a sprinter's build - large thighs and butt (33"" waist, 41"" hip, 23"" thigh"") - and on me these shorts in size 34 are true to size in the waist, and snug but not tight in the thigh which is perfect. The fabric has a wonderful feel and perfect weight to it, and my butt looks good which I appreciate.

I understand it is a tailored fit but we are all cyclists with big quads :) I ordered a 30 a while back and the waist and crotch area was too big but felt fine in the legs. I recently decided to try the 28 as I have a pair of Prana 28""x9"" shorts that fit great. The 28 is just the slightest bit snug in the waist but the legs grip my quads almost like a pair of cycling shorts. I'm just an average cyclist, not like I have sprinter legs.... They catch and bind up when I raise my legs making them very uncomfortable. I really like all my Ornot tops and want to buy these shorts but for the money they just do not fit me right.

1620,Joe Z.,29 Oct 2021,United States,4,"Great feeling, short shorts","Excellent shorts, nice short length and the material feels nice and stretchy.

1626,Mike E.,22 Oct 2021,United States,5,Great shorts!,"Firstly, I’m glad the additional measurements were there on the fit guide. The flat measurements for the waist and leg opening. I normally wear a 32, but according to the measurements I was a 30. 
The shorts themselves are a really nice quality! They have a slim fit with a low-ish waist. The legs are a bit shorter than I’m used to but that’s ok. They have a comfortable stretch to them and are surprisingly light weight. There aren’t many features really, except for 1 zippered back pocket, but their simplicity is what’s nice about them.

1627,Michael Z.,21 Oct 2021,United States,5,Stellar shorts on the bike and off.,"Bought these to pull double duty on bikes and well as work. I’m an audio engineer so I spend a lot of days on stages at arenas and festivals. They were super comfortable and breathable and held up wonderfully to the Texas summer. The following weekend I took them to a downhill bike park and they were amazing. Will be coming back for more colors. Fit is perfect, I’m 6’6” 32 inseam, true to size, not too long or short.

The material is outstanding, durable but light enough for the hot and humid south, and they dry super fast.

They fit well, are extremely comfortable (especially for someone with larger quads), and seem very durable. The perfect short for rides when you don't want to don your bibs. They're hefty without being stiff or overly heavy.

My only concern is that they're cut a bit shorter than i'm used to so, when I sit down, they ride quite high. But that's just because no one wants to see that much of my legs!

What really sold me, though—and this is true of all the pieces I’ve purchased from Ornot—is that they are made here in California. 

I wouldn’t change a thing… or not. I do wish there was a phone pocket, either dedicated on the side of the leg or a sleeve within one of the existing leg pockets, because the large pockets allow a phone to easily shift sideways.

1737,Jonathon T.,10 Aug 2021,United States,5,Love em- Olive shorts,"Stats: 5'8"" 150-155lbs 
Ideal Pant size: 31x30 but sometimes a 30 waist works and sometimes a 32 works. 
In this case, the 30 waist worked best for me, i also tried on the 32 but there was just a bit too much space for wearing without a belt. a 31 would have been right on the money!! 
Pros: color and material are perfect. Just enough stretch that they loosen up the longer you wear them, which is good for me cause the waist on the 30 reminds me that i need to chill on the pizza and beer. Snug on the thighs but i dig that, i dont have very big thighs and these still hug them, especially when your leg is bent (i.e., top of a pedal stroke) its almost as if youre wearing bibs. Helps keep those tan lines dialed. I would be comfortable wearing these on bike, in the dirt, bushwacking, in the water, at disneyland, to brunch, etc,.
-rear pocket zipper is a great touch
Cons: Some inconsistencies with the size of the front pocket opening. The pair of 32's had a way smaller opening than the 30's. I could barely get my hand through. I understand that this would be good for keeping items from falling out but there was definitely a noticeable difference. 
-Since the inside of the rear pockets are this really nice light mesh material and (I dont think) theyre attached to the short, they tend to get bunched up when pulling items like a wallet out, especially if the shorts are on the tighter side. A little annoying, but not a deal breaker for me. 

All in all, i would definitely recommend these shorts and would buy a pair in every color if they made a 31 waist and were a little cheaper, though i can understand the labor/material cost when manufacturing technical clothing in the USA. I have the vest, magic shell, couple of jerseys, bibs, socks, buttery cotton tees, and now the shorts to add to my Ornot collection. Love what this company does",N/A,Mission Short - Olive,30,N/A

1779,John M.,20 Jul 2021,United States,5,"Big Thigh Guys, Rejoice!","First, I’ll start by saying that I received my first pair in Slate, and within 5 minutes of walking around the house I put in another order for the Sage. 

I am 225lbs on a good day and wear a 36. My thighs, thunderous. My ***, thiccer than a snicker. Raised on corn and buttermilk biscuits, I am not the average size cyclist. And boy is it hard to find shorts that both comfortably fits my lower half and doesn’t have an inseam that makes me look like I’m wearing a pair of JNCO’s from my wildest 90’s fantasy. These solve all of those issues. As soon as I slipped these on I felt as though they were perfectly hugging my legs without being suffocating to my nether regions. Even while sitting, the stretch in these provides a hug more tender than your mother’s love. Soft and caressing, yet firm and supporting. I can’t wait to scoot around town on these for casual pub ride or an exploration day in the gravel saddle. 

Bottom line. Buy them.",N/A,Mission Short - Olive,36,N/A

1932,Patrick,15 Apr 2021,United States,5,Wow,"I think I've only ever written two or three product reviews in my entire life. I have worn these shorts for two weeks in a row after buying them in the sage color and then just bought them in the slate color. These are the best shorts I've ever had, especially if you're into the shorter inseam fit. The material has a slight course & durable texture to it. You can tell it won't rip anytime soon. The zippered back pocket is great for small things. I would use it for a passport if traveling, for example. Also, the pockets themselves have this super nice texture to it. It's like a very soft tactile, felt-like material combined with the durability of a rip-stop nylon type material. It's just great. They also stretch just enough. Yes these are very expensive, but if you wear them often I have no doubt it's worth it.",N/A,Mission Short - Sage,32,N/A
1933,Michael B.,14 Apr 2021,United States,5,One Short to Rule Them All!!!,"After having purchased shorts from a number of other cycling and non-cycling apparel brands over the years, its safe to say I've tried a few. My past favorites have since been discontinued...enter the Ornot short. Well, its not surprising that these are damn near perfect. I almost hesitate giving these shorts a 5 star review ONLY just because they are so hard to get your hands on a pair. If these get anymore 5 star reviews, I'll never get a pair in Obsidian (Black)! ;)

Fit: I'm a solid 30 inch waist in just about every pair of pants/short I own. The 30s are spot on...with a tad extra room, but not so much that I need a belt...perfect. Plus, theres enough give in the fabric that even if I did put on a few extra LBS it wouldn't be a big deal. I find the inseam length to be just about perfect for a short that doubles as a casual summer short and commuting to work short. Finally, the Sage color is super classy looking and goes with just about any color t-shirt...total win.

Construction: Top notch. I can tell by the care thats been taken into the materials and construction that these are going to last me a while. I tend find a pair of shorts that I like and then blow through them after about two years from relentless wear and repeated washings. I have a feeling these will last quite a bit longer. The riveted button and zipper are sturdy. Pocket liners are meshy so they breath when on the bike, and the rear right pocket has a zip closure on it (which is a great touch). I also have to say that I'm super stoked to be supporting a company that builds such a quality product right here in my home state of CA. Kudos!

These shorts are perfect for on the bike, kicking it around the house on the weekend, summer BBQs, backyard exploring and everything in between. If I had one bit of input to offer up, I'd say it be really cool if one of the front pockets had a zip closure, like the rear, so that it doesn't feel like my phone is going pop out of my pocket while on the bike running errands. Other than that, don't hesitate to buy a pair!!! 
Now please Ornot....can we get a restock of Obsidian in size 30. :D",N/A,Mission Short - Sage,30,N/A

2014,Oliver A.,27 Jan 2021,United States,5,Great Shorts,"So far, these shorts are just as great as the reviews claim. Hands down the most comfortable pair of shorts I've worn in a long time. Fabric feels durable, but is also very stretchy (enough to even do yoga in). 

I typically wear a size 33, and the 34 fits perfectly. I have pretty large quads, which typically is an issue with shorts, but these fit my legs quite well.

2015,Michael O.,27 Jan 2021,United States,5,Mission shorts,"First, I’m not a review writer-type. But, I’m super happy with my, now, third pair of mission’s. They are soo comfortable, you forget you’re wearing shorts. Durable for any all-out outdoor pursuits. I’ve trail ran, cycled, multi day hiked and at effort. Stain resistant, as i spilt an entire large coffee on my shorts an they came out like new. The fit is excellent, 32” fits on my hips without slipping, stretchy and great when active or sitting. Lastly, I had an exchange issue and waited for first issue of sapphire merino sweatshirt. Tyler of Ornot was so patient, pleasant and kept me informed during the process, excellent communication and follow up. Seem less customer service! That’s why I’m writing this, because seldom do you get anything remotely as professional and easy to work with as Ornot. Thanks again, Tyler! Ornot for life",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,32,N/A

I was somewhere between a 30"" and a 32"" (I'm 6', 165 lbs and generally wear pants at 30"" and 32""). I ordered the 32""—to be on the safe side and also because it was the only one in stock—and it fits my quads perfectly, but my waist is almost perfect with a belt.

The fabric is soft, stretchy and comfy, while at the same time feeling tough enough to survive bushwhacking and trail maintenance.

2043,James C.,27 Oct 2020,United States,4,solid errand shorts,"these shorts get the job done. the alternative back pocket styles, one zippered and one open, are convenient for storing things that you either want quick access to or want securely zipped up. 

the only issue I have with these is the sizing and proportions is a bit off for my taste -- the waist is a little too big and the inseam a little too small. I usually wear medium waist/32x32 pants and like shorts to fall an inch or two above the knee. I have to use a belt for these shorts and, when riding, they tend to hike way up past my tan lines, flashing a few inches of gloriously pale skin. it's not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of. some additional inseam length options would be good.",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,32,N/A

Material has the perfect amount of stretch and the leg diameter and open is also just right.

The fit does not seem to pair well with cycling bibs. The legs are a bit shorter than most of the legs on my bibs, so when walking, pedaling or bending over, the under layer tends to extend past the shorts.

For sizing, I wear a 31 and sized down fine. The stretch gives it the little extra give to hug my contours.

2124,Zach,01 Oct 2020,United States,5,nailed it again,"these shorts are great. the fabric is slightly thicker which means these shorts will last longer than comparable shorts. the waist fits true to size. the inseam is damn near perfect but be aware they are shorter than what you may be used to - they come down to just about where my bibs usually hit a bit above the knee.

the sewing and construction is meticulous. the fabric is spot on, and they are made in the USA and are carbon offset. they are priced perfectly for what they are. I just picked up a second pair in sage because I am fearful they will sell out of this most recent run. 

buy them, wear them, and spread the gospel - these OrNot's shorts are industry standards.",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,30,N/A

2130,Clint C.,30 Sep 2020,Hong Kong,4,"Very very good, almost great","I have 3 pairs. The first pair was the original slate colour and then I bought the other 2 colours recently.

Fit is perfect. I'm 5'8"" wearing medium. I've donated several other pairs of old favorite shorts (from Uniqlo) as the Mission short is really that great a fit.

However...

The first pair has a belt loop which is losing its threading and about to come undone. However I have rarely worn belts on it, so I find that a bit strange and even if I wore belts all the time I'd expect the loops to hold up better. I have not worn belts with other 2 pairs including this obsidian one. Gives me pause about clipping on keys.

Also on the first pair I got, after several months it's now worn in, and a bit looser around the waist than when I first got them. Not unexpected as that obviously happens with all clothing, but doesn't feel as great as the brand new ones that I have, and I believe due to the stretch fabric, it seems to loosen more than non-stretch shorts.

All-in-all, the best fitting shorts that I've worn. Quality is good, perhaps could be a bit better. Value is suspect at $108 a pair, but I don't think you're making massive margins off these anyway so that's fine.",N/A,Mission Short - Obsidian,30,N/A

2141,Samuel A.,19 Sep 2020,United States,5,Mission Shorts,"These shorts are fantastic. I’m a proponent of “fewer nicer things”, and they fit right into that ethos. 

Prior to purchasing these shorts, I had been wearing another Bay Area handmade cycling short. They lasted a solid 5 years, but the amount of pocket sewing and alterations made me look elsewhere for the next everyday wear. 

I originally ordered two pairs of these shorts, a size 30 & 32. I ended up exchanging the 32 for the 30 and couldn’t be happier. For reference, I’m 6’ 172 lbs. The inseam is nice a short, the gusset is wonderful, and they hug my quads comfortably. I prefer a tighter short and these have fit the bill. They are comfortable on the bike and appear to dry quickly. They do come with a DWR, though I’ve found it typically rubs off within a week or two — oh well! As long as they dry quickly, I’m happy 😊

They have a curious blue sheen that may be a result of the synthetic fabric. I would like to see a ""darker black” color, but this is a fairly minimal critique... I wear these almost daily, and I am a big fan. Highly recommended.",N/A,Mission Short - Obsidian,32,N/A
2149,Jeremy C.,17 Sep 2020,United States,5,My favorite kind of casual cycling wear,"I've loved everything about these shorts so far.

The only thing that kept me from ordering two is colder weather around the corner. I wear them almost every day and hand wash/hang dry so I don’t have to wear anything else. The material is a great mix of durability and soft feel. Fit is perfect for me, which has been hard to find from other brands. The 28 is just right on my waist with a minimally tightened belt and the legs look great on my quads which must be bigger than the average skinny guy because no one else seems to get it right. Commuting 8 miles round trip by bike and on my feet for 8 hours and they’re always comfortable and aren’t disgustingly smelly by the time I’m getting home.

Do be warned, however, the thighs are definitely borderline too tight for riding (killer for off-bike casual), but they seemed to stretch just the right amount during a ride.

2256,Jordan S.,21 Nov 2019,United States,4,Solid Everyday Short,"Shorts are well constructed and will be a great choice for everyday wear. 

My only issue was sizing. At 6’1, 175-180lbs I was deciding between 33 & 34. The 33 waist was perfect but slimmer in thighs (the shorts would be perfect if it was a 33 waist with the 34 thighs)",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,,N/A

Luckily when they finally restocked I was able to snag a pair! Since receiving them I have been very impressed by their fit, build quality and versatility. I travel a lot and these have become my go to shorts due to their color and wrinkle resistance if packed in a frame bag. The fit on these is also great for a skinny cyclist with big legs...always tough to find something that fits and pumped that ornot hit the bullseye on these!",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,,N/A

2292,Matthew G.,16 Aug 2019,United States,4,"Awesome shorts, some odd stitching.","They fit amazingly well. You can jump on the bike and they look smart enough to wear around, too. A+.

The only downside: The way the stitching is along the pocket crease causes the pocket interior to try and escape as you move around. It’s not bad, I just have to push the pockets in every once in a while as they start to creep out. Happens on both pair I own.",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,,N/A

I loved the fabric, the feel, the length & the leg width…but unfortunately, as the entire short fit perfectly-albeit the waist was too large. I won’t be able to size down for the waist to fit, bc in turn the rest of the shorts (the thighs, the length, the crotch) will be way too tight. I want the overall size of the 33, but the waist of the 32. Just not a great fit for my body, unfortunately.",N/A,Mission Short - Slate,,N/A
