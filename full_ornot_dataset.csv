2,Michael W.,2023-02-28,United States,5.0,Great all round jacket but not fully waterproof,"I love this jacket. I wear it everyday, both on the bike and off it. It’s comfy, warm, had good pockets, and great features like a large rear pocket, warm liner, and a big hood. 

There are a couple of things that I’d love to see in version 2.0 which include:
- full waterproofing. This current version seems splash proof but it definitely isn’t fully waterproof. Any moderate to heavy rain will soak the jacket
- elastic cinch straps around wrists and waist. This would be great for keeping the wind out of my sleeves!

Ultimately, this jacket is great, I’m very happy with my purchase and would buy it again.",3.0,trail magic jacket - gravel,Large,"184cm, 85kg",2023,Jackets/Vests,large
3,Nicholas,2023-02-12,United States,4.0,Functional with a great fit*,"I put an asterisk for great fit because the jacket is marketed as something you can wear on and off the bike which is true because the cut is different compared to regular cycling clothing, however the sleeves are far too long for shorter people. I'm 5'7 and typically wear jackets with 32-32.5"" sleeves because anything longer will results in the sleeves bunching up. The sleeves when straightened all the way out cover half of my hand. The long sleeve length is perfect for when you're on the bike, but since the jacket is marketed towards on and off the bike wear, I would have liked to see a more normal sleeve length. Perhaps incorporating velcro cuffs so you can still block wind from coming in while riding and having a more normal sleeve length would have been a better option, at least to me. 

Functionality wise the jacket is perfect. I got too hot in it in 45F weather with only a thin long sleeve and short-sleeve jersey underneath so if you frequently bike in cold weather, this jacket will work well. The back pocket is nice for storing extra gubbins if you don't want items in side pockets dragging the jacket down.

I'm someone who likes things to fit a certain way and have strong preferences, hence my tirade about sleeve length. I kept the jacket because it still provides utility for riding despite the fit making it a no-go for casual wear (for me).

10,Andrew N.,2023-01-29,United States,4.0,Pretty nice,"Overall this is a pretty nice jacket that has served me well in mild to somewhat chilly rides. I appreciate the flexibility of vest + outer shell. As a tall person, I appreciate the sleeves are a pretty good length on their own and if tucked into a glove for colder days. I have two minor nits that prevent me from giving five stars. First, it would be nice if the sleeve cuffs had a Velcro strap or elastic to control airflow up the sleeve. Second, pit zips would be really helpful to moderate temps too.",,trail magic jacket - gravel,Medium,,2023,Jackets/Vests,medium

12,AC,2022-12-15,United States,5.0,Allllmost perfect for winter,"I have an earlier version of the magic shell jacket (without taped seams) and I love it. This jacket is a little different in some key ways. I bought the Trail Magic jacket during the fall sale, which was the only way I could justify it. It's definitely warmer and I often find myself overdressing on 25-40 degree days. It's kind of a mind-bender how few layers are needed with either of these jackets. As I've not dialed in the layering aspect, I'm not sure if there's any difference in breathability between this jacket and the shell. I appreciate the extended zipper length at the throat. I like the hand pockets and the rear pocket is cavernous. The fit is looser, but still comfortable and not flappy. I'm not thrilled about hoods in general, but this one feels unobtrusive. I'm 70"" tall and 160# and the medium fits me well with enough room for a layer. So what would I like to see change? For the most part, I would like to see additions. I really wish that Ornot were less stingy with reflective bits, especially on shoulder/winter season gear. The sun sets at 430 and conditions can be crummy and I don't want to be worrying about whether or not I'm being seen. My magic shell is morocco in color, but the jacket is a sort of greyish blue or blue-ish grey - take your pick, either way, it doesn't lend itself to visibility in less than ideal conditions. Finally, I feel like I actually need to stop for a photo or to check/send a text. I've been keeping my phone in the big back pocket and while I can access it while riding, it would be a stretch to call it convenient. I would much prefer a zip Napoleon pocket. Overall, I'm very pleased with this jacket and I appreciate that it's made in the USA.",3.0,trail magic jacket - gravel,Medium,"70"", 160",2022,Jackets/Vests,medium

20,Cameron G.,2022-11-15,United States,5.0,Limited Experience - So Far So Good,"I live in Southeast Michigan. I’ve cycled in this jacket three times. Once, it was around 45˚F. The jacket was great. I also used an Ornot longsleeve merino base layer on that ride. I removed the inner liner for this ride. The jacket blocked a decent amount of wind and kept me warm.

The second ride was at Iceman Cometh in Traverse City, MI. The temps during the race were about 60˚F with a lot of humidity. I was extremely overdressed for the race and had to stop to shed this jacket and my base layer. I was also wearing the Ornot long thermal bib, which was way warmer than I needed too. (I’m new to riding in colder weather…)

The third ride was 32˚F with a decent amount of wind. This time I wore the base layer, a long sleeve jersey, and this jacket with the liner. The climbs were warm, the descents were chilly (but not frigid), and everything else was fine. 

I haven’t yet exposed the jacket to extreme rain during a ride. I’ve been dumped on while standing around in it, and I didn’t get soaked. So that’s good. 

TL;DR: my experience wearing this jacket is limited. It has worked well so far. I have not tried any other brand’s jacket that is specifically marketed to cyclists, so I’m not sure whether paying almost $400 is worth it. But it’s doing well so far.",3.0,trail magic jacket - black,Medium,"5’ 10”, 155lb",2022,Jackets/Vests,medium
21,Josh W.,2022-08-10,United States,4.0,Great jacket but not 99% waterproof,"I wrote a review previously and gave the Trail Magic five stars but I wanted to give an update but I was not able to edit the previous review. So I took along this jacket on a trip to Spain and rode through northern Spain this past April. It rained lightly and I was confident that I brought along the right jacket for the job, I was wrong, the jacket dose not repel water. Water absorbs into the shell material and eventually all the way through very shortly. Again it was a very light rain. After riding with this jacket for 10 straight days there are two things that I would have liked: 1. a chest pocket for passport/wallet/cell phone. 2. a different material just around the cuff that won't fray or get damaged by Velcro from riding gloves. Beside this, I still love the jacket, I like that the hood actually covers my helmet, the fit is perfect (not baggy and not to slim), can add warmth when needed with removable vest, and the jacket fits in off the bike as well.",,trail magic jacket - gravel,Medium,,2022,Jackets/Vests,medium

28,Chase V.,2022-06-09,United States,5.0,The ‘Perfect’ jacket,"What else do you call a jacket that works its way into your heart and becomes your favorite piece of clothing? It is the perfect weight, keeping you comfortable on cool, misty mornings and evenings when the chill comes in just after sunset. It has a light layer of insulation inside, which can be removed if temps are moderate, so it can serve as a light shell. Or keep the insulation in, add a light layer underneath, and it can manage some reasonably chilly conditions. A brilliantly versatile design.
Plus, the windproof fabric is soft and comfortable to the touch. The fit is just right; trim, but not tight. The sleeves are long enough to get all the way down to the wrists, no annoying gaps where painful bits of cold air can intrude, solving one of life’s thorny issues...

The fit is great - I was deciding between a small and medium and really glad I got the small. Fits well even with a base & thermal layer underneath.
I also wore this (without the thermal vest layer) for a 45 degree rainy outdoor cross training session.

Was so impressed with the jacket (sized M for riding) I purchased another jacket (sized L) for work purposes for layering and how well in breathes during movement as I tend to sweat at my job moving heavy things.

This thing is absolutely comfortable. Not the least bit rubbery or sticky feeling like some other rain jackets. The material is honestly a miracle. I’m serious when I say that I grab for this jacket now when I might have otherwise reached for a cotton hoodie. I did find it ran a touch small across the chest. I’m solid a S in Ornot tops but when the S arrived I found it a bit constricting in the body, and as I was using this off-bike mostly, I returned for a M (which is perfect).

The dual-ended (bi-directional?) zipper is amazing when I'm wearing a base layer + cap air crew + included vest and need a tiny bit more room in the hips to be comfy. The arms are quite long but work perfectly on the bike for those of us with swimmer arms, especially if you don't mind cuffing off the bike. The large zip pocket isn't the most flattering when wearing many layers but the vanity hits are worth it for the cozy points.

Fits like a glove, keeps me toasty, yet unbelievably breathable. So far, I have opted to mostly wear it without the fleece vest liner. But, the vest alone has already proved to be an awesome warmth boost during the awkward shoulder season in the CO Rocky Mountains. I thought I might fall between SM and MED as I generally do, but given the more relaxed fit of this jacket, the small fits great - plenty of room to still be worn more casually, yet slim enough to make me feel slick on the bike.

The trail magic shell is just so good. Stretchy, breathable AND waterproof is no joke. It’s so comfy and also functional. The vest isn’t really my style to wear on its own but the extra layering option is nice for sure.

100,Brendan H.,2023-01-22,United States,3.0,"I want to love it, needs a few adjustments though.","I bought this jacket in November and I live in Washington DC area so I have had some time to try in a mix of conditions. There is a lot to like about this jacket. The material is great - it is stretchy in a way that helps it disappear when you wear it. The material is also very breathable and has worked for me in a wide variety of conditions/temperatures. The zipper also feels solid. 

The issues appear however with a couple of other design elements. First, I bought this jacket in a large size and I am 6' 1"" and 175 lbs. I feel like I have pretty standard build. I have found that the large size jacket feels a bit short in terms of length through the torso as well as in the arms. For the torso, my regular jersey that I wear underneath is about 3 to 4 inches longer than the Ornot jacket and the drop of the back of the jacket is not very pronounced compared with most of the other jackets I have owned before. Similarly, the arms feel a bit short and I think that they could benefit from a bit of a silicon grippers inside sleeve where the sleeve sits on the glove. I have found that especially in bumpier gravel the sleeve creeps up toward the top of the glove.",2.0,men's magic shell jacket - morocco,Large,"6' 1"" 175 lbs",2023,Jackets/Vests,large

A merino baselayer, thermal jersey, and the magic shell keep me perfectly warm without things getting swampy, and a quick unzip can get me through warmer spots without a problem. Even when the jacket is just on the verge to being too warm, as soon as the group stops and the heart rate drops, I'm glad to still be wearing it.
As far as fit goes, I took advantage of this color running 1/2 size smaller. I'm a dead ringer for a small, but a medium in this color gives me enough room for those two layers underneath without feeling constricted. However, I just wore it out over a t shirt today for a rainy errand, and it felt great then as well, so I'm sure it has enough stretch to accommodate layers even if you don't try to game the sizing.

153,Ray S.,2022-02-21,United States,3.0,Mixed feelings,"My experience is mixed. I've worn the jacket in temperatures from 33-55 degrees F. For the colder ride, my arms were a little cold with 2 layers underneath but only one was long sleeve. For the warmer ride, I did not overheat. So, the jacket has a wide range of temperatures where it works well. My base layers for all rides have been dry, so the jacket does vent water vapor. I have not ridden in the rain, so I can't comment on how it sheds water.

I gave the jacket 3 stars for two reasons: 1) The available colors. I see lots of people riding in black, so it is obviously a popular color. However, I think it's unsafe. You don't see road construction workers wearing black safety vests. And the Morocco is about the most ucky yellow I've seen. (I did buy it though.) 2) The almost unusable pocket. I don't really care that pocket doubles a stash bag. I'd rather have some real cycling pockets and a separate/stand-alone stash bag. Also, the zipper on the pocket is hard to use. To zip it up, you have to reach around back with your left hand and hold the jacket down and then pull up with your right hand at just the right angle. Luckily, the jacket does have two very good front zippers. You can unzip from the bottom to gain access to jersey packets. 

I bought the medium. After first trying it on, I debated whether to exchange it for a large since it felt too tight. But since I'm 5'4"" and 145 pounds, I thought a large just wouldn't be right. After wearing the jacket though, I'm glad I kept the medium. The stretchiness allowed a close fit and was not uncomfortable. 

Even with these negatives, I still think the jacket is a good value. I did look at jackets from other companies and found some that claimed similar functionality at much higher prices.",3.0,magic shell jacket 2020 - morocco,Medium,"5'4"" 145 pounds",2022,Jackets/Vests,medium

i normally do lots of climbing and descending, which means big changes in temp, wind, weather. this jacket might be overkill for most socal riding, but for winter it's amazing. if you're riding in the santa monica mountains, angeles crest, etc, you'll probably overheat on the way up but will be very thankful at the peak and on the way down. when i rode up in port reyes area this winter it was amazing. if ornot would send me a discount code best believe i'm getting a micro climate for the rest of the season. only two jackets you'd need, as far as i can tell",,magic shell jacket 2020 - black,,,2021,Jackets/Vests,No size provided by reviewer

With this Magic Shell, I went out today in 34 to 60 degrees this morning. Underneath I had a long sleeve fleece thermal jersey and a summer sleeveless base layer and was totally comfortable, although I had to unzip all the way at around 58 degrees. I'm impressed by how well these jackets can block the wind, yet still breathe well, and they fit well so there's no flapping around while riding. I have older wind jackets that would always be noisy in the wind, or inflate up like the Michelin man - definitely not very aero.

I tried almost a dozen other jackets from Rapha, Pearl Izumi and Castelli and compared against these 2 and the Ornot jackets just fit better with the stretch fabric, look great, and are easier to use with the bigger dual zippers. 

I'm 5'10"", 155 lbs, typical cyclist arms, and a little squish around the middle. The medium Magic Shell fits snug with the thick fleece long sleeve jersey but still comfortable and not tight.

I really ""researched"" what jacket to buy as I tend to geek out about stuff like this and obviously settled on the Magic Shell. Like many here, when it showed up, I thought no way does this keep me warm in NE Ohio as its so light and small. Boy has it surprised me so far! I've used it in 25 degree (F) to 55 degrees and its been perfect in both (in fact, this past weekend, it warmed from 25-62 during a 3 hour ride!). Conditions like that make it almost impossible to dress properly but with the ability to simply remove some layers, I was able to stay comfortable the entire time out. I've used it in heavy rain and 41 degrees and sun and 55. Amazingly, the most I've layered is a thin base layer, long sleeve jersey, and the Magic Shell. I run cold so that really says a lot! The two way zipper is also a feature I was surprised by. I honestly didnt see the big deal about it until I began using it. What an incredible feature (I will never own another outer layer that doesnt have this as it allows for more heat dissipation if needed and better, really easy access to jersey pockets). If I had one nit about the jacket it the lack of an open external pocket. I actually wish it had a chest pocket for a phone. Certainly not a deal breaker. The fit is awesome with no flapping around (I'm 5-9"" and 152lbs and medium is perfect). Basically fits like a winter jersey but lighter so I can actually put it in a pocket if needed or pack it if bikepacking. The ""Magic"" comes in how it regulates heat. Sure, its wind and waterproof but what sells me is that I am never really cold or really hot when I am wearing it. As I heat up even a little, I can actually feel the heat dissipate keeping me dry and right on. Its honestly like having a thermostat set to auto! Hard to explain but I think Ornot has made the perfect jacket here. I havent had a chance to ride in really cold temps with it yet (below 15 deg F) but I suspect that a merino base layer, mid layer, thermal jersey and the Magic Shell and I should be good to go without looking like the MIchelin Man.

206,Tim A.,2021-10-05,United States,4.0,Magic Shell -,"The main goal of this review is to help my fellow cyclist feel more confident about size selection. I am between sizes so I spent more time than any reasonable person would reviewing the size charts and reading other user reviews. I am ultimately not 100% satisfied with the size I ended up with.

The jacket itself is very nice. It truly does work like magic. It’s light yet warm and you don’t feel clammy as you begin to sweat. I would say it’s worth the money if you ride in cold weather. 

Back to size selection. I had ordered both a Medium and a Large so that I could try on both. Ultimately returning the one that didn’t fit. Ornot’s size chart had me squarely in a medium. When I tried the medium on at home it immediately felt too tight. The large felt less so but still had good compression so I went with the large. The mistake I made was thinking that the fit experienced in my living room would be the same fit on the bike. 

While out riding on my first outing with the jacket it felt like it was too loose in the sleeves and I noticed a little flapping around the neck and lower back.This bugs me and I wanted to return it but Ornot’s return policy does not allow for worn garments. Even though it was within the 30 day exchange window. 

This is my mistake and I am 100% accountable. I am still disappointed when Ornot said they couldn't exchange it unless they charged me an arbitrary restocking fee. My mistake but I wasn’t willing to pay the penalty. 

Go by the sizing charts and think about how the fit will be while riding and you should be fine! If you like it a little loose then size up but if you want that nice performance feel while riding the sizing charts are on the money!",4.0,magic shell jacket 2020 - morocco,Medium,"6’1""",2021,Jackets/Vests,medium

223,RC,2021-08-09,United States,5.0,Great jacket,"I ride a lot in the early morning during the summer. Where I live, that means it's usually in the 50's when I set out, and it's windy and often foggy to the point of mist. This jacket is perfect for that weather--just a base layer under it and I'm good to go. I have no doubt that it will keep me warm on much colder days if I put a thermal jersey or a more substantial base layer under it. I'm very happy to have something that covers such a wide temperature range. 

I love the zippered pocket and would love it more if it were bigger; it does hold my phone, though, which is the main thing I want to put in it, and I could easily get a bar or two in there as well.

If you're in between sizes like I am, here's what I decided on: I'm about 6'1"" and 175 pounds. I tried both M and L. The M fits me a little more tightly than the fit that's pictured in the main photo above. The L has enough extra material that it didn't feel right. The zipper on the L bulges out in a couple of places when I'm standing and really bulges when I lean over as if on a bike. The fit in the back with the L is a little loose, and with the M it's snug. The arms on both jackets are long enough that they didn't factor in. I went with the M because I wanted a really functional, on-bike fit and am OK with how tight it is. I'd say the advice Ornot provides on fit is spot on. I should have just trusted their table/advice and gone with M to start with, but I wanted to be really sure I was getting the right jacket. Hopefully I'll help someone else feel confident enough to order just one size and avoid the return process.

Nearly all of my jerseys are also a medium, while my bibs are split between a large and medium. I purchased this jacket in a large and it's perfect. I've only used this in temperatures ranging from 15 to 40 degrees F. On the coldest ride, I was wearing a lightweight long sleeve merino wool base layer and a heavier weight long-sleeve cycling jersey beneath this jacket. Everything was snug but not uncomfortable. Adding a layer or the thickness of one of those layers would make the jacket too tight. That said, I was plenty warm at 15 degrees F with that setup (note that I'm in Minnesota and might have a higher tolerance for cold weather cycling than most). For rides near 40 F, I had just a lightweight merino layer and it was nearly perfect in temperature and fit. The stretch of this jacket is absolutely wonderful.

Took it out for a few rides so far and a run in pouring rain to see how it holds up in inclement weather and I have to say... the material is fantastic! Surprised that it doesn’t smell up like others do so I can get a few uses out of it before having to wash. My real issue is sizing. I had to purchase a men’s size L to fit myself in it because the females sizing only goes up to large - I’m a large in casual clothing but ornots large runs small. The mens fits me just right in the torso, but the sleeves are way too long and unfortunately too small in the waist. I look like I’ve stuffed myself into a sausage casing in the waist section and it rides up when fully zipped. I wish ornot would consider that not all women who ride have an athletic build and provide sizing and cut made for the fluffier riders who like a looser fit. Oh well.. it will motivate me to lose my belly fat faster because I really do love this jacket.",,magic shell jacket 2020 - morocco,Large,,2020,Jackets/Vests,large

In my opinion, this jacket will keep you plenty toasty with the right layering underneath in temps as low as the upper 30s. It's absolutely perfect for rides (and runs) when it's in the 40s & 50s with just a lightweight base layer.

I’d be excited to see more bright colored options, maybe some added reflexivity. I’m often leaving when it’s dark in the winter so increased visibility is very desirable.

It’s kept me dry in the rain and didn’t even tear when I crashed descending in the rain this weekend. 

One thing to know: it’s fairly bulky and doesn’t compress a ton, so if you’re looking for a shell to carry with you for the occasional shower I’d look elsewhere.

343,Yeen,2020-11-09,United States,5.0,The real deal,"Ok they absolutely nailed it with this jacket. I was looking for an aero fitting jacket that is stretchy and comes in a color other than ""run me over black"". This one looked like it would fit the bill so I pulled the trigger after reading some positive reviews on it. 

Breathability is amazing, I tested this doing hard vo2 max and long 40'+ threshold efforts up climbs in 30-50 deg and never have an issue getting soggy except minor sweat on arms, the torso and armpits are very breathable preventing any sweat buildup. 

Windproofing is really good as well, so you don't get cold on fast descents. I just rode this jacket for 4 hours in the snow @ 24 deg f and was not cold at all so it can handle the lower temps for sure. I have been layering with a merino longsleeve base and jersey for most rides. Above 50 deg F I would be unzipping or layering down. 

A size medium fits me quite snug as an athletic build 5'9"" 165lb, if you are concerned about layering underneath I would size up to a large, but personally I enjoy the tight fit. Also the jacket is tapered at the bottom so it doesn't bunch up on your stomach when you're in a riding position. I really like not having jersey style pockets in the back because I prefer to use my jersey pockets underneath and find them to ruin the aesthetic of the jacket. The jacket is also very lightweight for the warmth it provides. 

The only thing I would change is to reverse the zipper direction on the back so that zip-down is to close the pocket instead of open as it is much easier to close zippers down when using gloves and this is becoming common practice for most ski jackets nowadays. Other than that this jacket is definitely badass and worth the money imo, would be cool to see some more colorways but I enjoy the hi viz green.

450,Manny,2020-03-28,United States,5.0,Simply the Best,"Finding the perfect cycling jacket has been an ongoing dilemma in my life. Let’s call it a mission. I’ve ridden in the Castelli Alpha ROS and the Rapha winter jacket (which are frequently rated the best). I can now say that they absolutely do not hold a candle to this jacket. This is LITERALLY magic. I’ve worn it in a light rain and stayed dry and cool, I’ve worn it in frigid conditions with a jersey underneath and been toasty, I’ve worn it in cold rain with a thermal jersey underneath and been dry AND toasty. Heck, I’ve even worn it in light wind and never overheated. I loved it so much I got it in every color available. The rear pocket is a dream. Far too many jackets pile jersey-style pockets on the rear of the jacket which seems absolutely pointless to me. I already have three small pockets on my jersey. The pocket here is large enough to stash a baselayer or vest or whatever I need. It’s easy to access should I put my phone back there and need to snap an emergency selfie. To put it mildly: this jacket is beyond perfect.

Glad I did -- snug, but comfortable. Sleeve length is fine, and the stretch allows pulling them over the cuffs of rain gloves. On the rare snow ride in upper 30s with a Gabba jersey underneath, I was afraid of the amount of stress I was putting on the zipper with loaded jersey pockets, but I guess that's a reason to get a bar bag. Speaking of pockets, that's the one gripe: the zipper pull on the back pocket is pretty useless; it's really small and hard to feel with gloves on, and it's a contrast to the main zipper which is sturdy AF. At least the main zipper has two sliders, so you can get to your jersey pockets easily.

Finally got some decent sprinkle on my ride today and it didn't wet through, which I totally thought it would, so that's pretty cool. I assume if you do a long ride and there is lots of rain it will eventually soak through, but pretty impressed with the water resistance this jacket offers.

I have even worn this jacket with no shirt or jersey underneath (don't ask). The material is comfortable against your skin, unlike every other jacket I've ever had which all felt like wrapping yourself in a plastic bag. 

The only thing that would improve this jacket would be a bit of elastic at the wrists, they can be a little flappy at times, but this is really picky.

AS far as sizing, I am tall, with weirdly long arms but also pretty thin, so nothing ever fits me 😂 . I went with a size I thought would be long enough but not so flappy around the waist that it wasn't good on the bike. It almost is long enough in the arms!

The temps ranged from upper 40s to start to mid 50s by the finish, but there was the wind. The jacket performed flawlessly, keeping me warm and comfortable the entire ride. 

I tend to fall in the gap between L and XL depending on brand and cut, so I ordered both sizes and elected to stick with the XL. I am happy I stayed with the XL because I tend to layer more than some and had not problem wearing the jacket over a base layer and short-sleeve jersey.

469,Naz H.,2020-02-25,United States,5.0,It's definitely magic,"I've not been a fan of cycling jackets in general. They've either fit me like a deflated hot air balloon, have terrible packability, or are for the hardcore days (i.e. Rapha softshell or Hardshell). 

My first encounter with something that straddled the line between weight-to-warmth, waterproof-to-breathability, and had good fit and finish was Castelli's Gabba line. But even those pieces were too warm if the temperature rose a little, and packability, even on the vest was still relatively large.

I live and ride primarily in the Bay Area so temps range from 40s to 60s in the mornings and in the winter, the temps can stay right around that 40-50 range. A ride can take you against the sun, but then into a back valley that drops 10 degrees. A jacket like this keeps all of those concerns away. Paired with the PowerWool thermal jersey, you're golden.

Layer with a thicker base layer or wool, or even a regular LS wool baselayer or Henley that's not cycling specific, and this jacket is casual and high-performing enough to carry you through a wide range of temps.

I love that it fits more like a jersey and has a lovely soft handfeel but is still a shell — they are not kidding about the stretch!

The build quality is top notch and I love how breathable it is but yet does a really nice job on the decent sun blocking out the wind. It’s perfect for changing conditions. The only downside for me is that it does not have rear pockets. With a jacket like this I would love to just use it with a short sleeve or long sleeve base layer but this is really not possible since nearly all base layers don’t have pockets and the jacket doesn’t have pockets I have no wear to store my extra gear. As a result I need to wear one of my long sleeve jerseys with a pocket which in certain situations is just not as efficient as having a simple base layer.

We have had some super cold mornings in LA recently and the jacket has been perfect for the 30-40 degree temps. I have paired it with the Power Wool jersey and it has been the perfect combo for my rides. The Magic Shell's balance between blocking the wind and still being breathable is truly what makes it magic. 

Clothes always fit me funny because I have random measurements (5'7"" 190lbs 34 inch waist and 42 chest), so I went with the Large. It fits me perfectly with exception to sleeve length.

478,Lo,2020-02-10,United States,5.0,VERY impressed,"I've worn this jacket three times now and got caught in the rain twice; last weekend put it through the wringer in a 70-mile ride in 40 degree weather with on-and-off freezing rain, wind, and one heavy downpour. I was suspicious at first, because it really does look like the fabric wets out (gets a lot darker and wet-looking) but NO, after five hours I was totally dry underneath, just a little damp from sweat. Wore it with nothing but an Icebreaker merino longsleeve underneath and was toasty warm the whole ride. I was debating between this and a Gore ShakeDry jacket but I'm glad I went for this. I'll definitely wear this on dry, cold days. 
I'm a woman, so the sizing isn't going to be perfect, but the Small is roomy enough for a LS jersey underneath. I'm usually an XS in men's stuff at 5'7"" 135lbs w/wide shoulders. The sleeves are definitely long, and I'm going to have to get the waist tailored in. 
I dig the two-way zip, but wish the back pocket zip pull was just a little more hefty. Trying to grab it with gloves on is close to impossible. It would be great to see a women's version in lighter colors too!

I love how small it packs up so I could ditch it for the uphills and when the sun was out. 

I had the same issue as some other reviewers with the sleeve length - they are really long. I expected a little bit long since I am a gal, but they were super long.

Could be a fraction longer but definitely wouldn’t want it any shorter. It’s very trim, but perfect for club roadie rides when you wear aero, tight stuff.

Could probably wear the same items into high 30 degree weather and still be OK. Blocks out the wind like a suit of armor, haven't tested it in rain yet. The back procket is great and the fabric stretch makes it comfy AF.

Only issue I had was the sizing but the folks at Ornot were great on the return. For reference I am 5'9"" - 170 with a 44"" chest. Definitely on the thicc side and I initially ordered a medium which made me look like I was stuffed into a a sausage casing. The jacket still fit although stretched to the max.

Very stretchy for a waterproof jacket, which is nice. Keeps me warm, or at least not freezing cold, even on long mountain descents (think Diablo in winter...). Breathes quite well, but if the temperatures warm enough, it does get somewhat stuffy. The material on the inside is a bit ""grabby"", so I always wear arm warmers so it will not stick to my skin, even if it's just thin sunsleeve material. The easiest way I've found to take it off is just pull your arms out and then flip the sleeves back. Doesn't really pack up small like thinner vests and jackets, so I just roll up the body and tie it around my waist (I don't care what it looks like haha!) The large rear pocket is nice for storing larger items, but with the double zip, it's very easy to access my jersey pockets. Haven't ridden it in the rain yet, but a few times I've splashed water on it, it beads up nicely. One note about sizing, I normally wear a size small in Ornot jerseys, but the small jacket was too tight for me. I'm 5'9"", 64kg, with a more athletic build, the jacket was too tight around my chest and back, and on my shoulders.

The breath ability factor alone is worth. I don’t finish felling damp or soaked. I used it this past weekend with the OrNot long sleeve base layer and a jersey in 55 F and windy conditions and was comfortable the entire time. The only thing that leaves me wanting more is if it had a back pocket for storage.

Fit is perfect for a regular/sprinter sized human and having the water proof feature with a jacket that doesn’t crinkle like an empty Doritos bag or flap in the wind like a sail all while feeling substantial enough to wear just as a wind blocker is amazing.

610,Matthew M.,2019-02-06,United States,4.0,"Close, but not quite","The neoshell material is great, and works as advertised. Light, strechy, highly wind and water resistant. The medium was a perfect fit for me (5'9"", 160-ish, 41"" chest), slim fitting without feeling too tight, plenty of length in the sleeves.

However, the zipper/draft flap combo ruined this jacket for me. I could not reliably use the zip (especially the lower one) without it getting fouled in the draft flap material, sometimes to the point of worrying that I wouldn't be able to get out of the jacket. I ended up returning mine, as this isn't acceptable at this price point (to me). Fix this issue and I'd buy another one without hesitation. Kudos to Ornot on handling the return. If you don't typically adjust your zipper while out on a ride, this may not be an issue for you.

Things I'd like in the next version - reflective tabs sewn in the seams at the wrist, maybe sewn down the length of the jacket in front of the zipper as well.

I currently work at a boutique in San Francisco that produces outer where with Polartec fabric and instantly knew this item would be a winner.
To begin, I ordered my true to size as suggested by Ornot and though my initial wear of the shell, I felt that it was a little snug after 2 rides it had stretched to a comfortable fit. 
Currently, I use this shell for early morning cold and damp rides but also use it for my commutes to school and work. This shell is breathable but yet holds in heat giving me the perfect level of comfort. On my colder rider, I simply wear a base layer and then my shell as the jersey and it has been nothing less than amazing.

First, the zipper works great. Doesn’t snag or get caught up. The actual material is so comfortable and warm. I wore it on a somewhat cold Austin morning, I think the temperature was hovering around 40 degrees and it kept me warm and comfortable. Again, this jacket breathes! It’s so great. Lastly, when Ornot says waterproof, they mean it. I haven’t tested it in an extreme downpour but I’ve tested it with rain and mist and it kept me dry. I highly recommend this jacket. I’ve seen some people complain that there are no pockets on the back but I didn’t care and I’ve gotten a few compliments about it. I think it gives the jacket a cleaner look.

Secondly, what a great product! It fit nicely in my back pocket during the Mt. Ventoux climb (Malaucene side) and, after summiting, it provided relief from the wind and chill of the descent, all the way back to Bedoin, where being in the low 70's, it quickly went back in the pocket.
We repeated the climb the next day, from Bedoin this time, and the jacket came out at Chalet Reynard as, you guessed it, it was super windy, and it stayed on until we reached the lavender fields on our way to Sault.

Tam, and was not disappointed (by either the garment or the ride)! After building up my bike near the Golden Gate Bridge I threw on the jacket knowing it was going to be windy crossing over the bridge. I took it off once the climb up Mt. Tam started and was feeling a bit toasty. Quite pleased with how easily it stuffed into a jersey pocket even sharing a space with my cell phone. After rising above the fog it got a little chillier and windier and I put it back on. On the descent to the north, it was getting later in the day and there was condensation dripping from the denser forest sections. With the swifter speeds and less sun exposure I was glad to have the protection from the Microclimate. The double zipper pull, at first glance a minor detail, is key when it comes to fine tuning the temperature control and accessing the jersey pockets without stopping. The material excels at keeping out the wind yet is breathable when working hard. When wearing it you don't even notice it's there, which is exactly what you want from any piece of cycling kit.

826,Tim A.,2022-04-17,United States,5.0,Fantastic Addition to my Cycling Wardrobe,When I first starting riding I purchased a cheap nylon jacket from one of the big online bike retailers. It felt clammy and served as a parachute while out riding. Needless to say the Micro Climate Jacket is lightyears ahead of my first jacket. You should trust the Ornot size chart. Mine fits perfect. Snug but too much so. The material is stretchy and gives you the freedom to move. The jacket truly does perform in a wide range of temperatures. On my first ride wearing the jacket I left the house in 61 degree weather. While out riding the temperate fell to a cool 48 degrees. Unzipped going up the climbs but at the temperatures dropped I remained comfortable. The material on this jacket is incredible and it packs down small when not needed. Buy with confidence.

827,BW,2022-04-15,United States,5.0,Perfection,"I was really in the fence about this jacket for a few months. I was not sure about the weight and definitely was not sure about the Morocco color. I did not want another fluoro colored jacket. The first time I used the jacket was at the Fish Rock race. The morning temperature was cool and the first part of the ride covered steep terrain on shaded roads. Although this jacket feels light it works perfectly for blocking wind and breathing. I wore it for half of the ride until the big climb and warm temperatures hit although I feel like I still would have been comfortable if I left it in. For the color, I am very pleased that it is not a yellow as the pictures show. It has a bit of muted olive tint to it which is very appealing and unique. On the Fish Rock ride there were at least 6 people who commented on how great the jacket looks and especially the color. It packs up very small to fit in my jersey pocket too. I’m convinced this is one of the most perfect jerseys possible. Definitely give it a try. Just wish I would have waited to get the free macgyver strap.

888,Michael B.,2022-01-10,United States,5.0,Worth the Investment!,"I held off on writing a review for this jacket until I could get some milage on it. I just finished a 7 week training block with a lot of early mornings on the coast here in So Cal.and I'm really impressed. This jacket replaced a lightweight ""breathable"" pro team jacket by another manufacturer (rhymes with Mafa) . That jacket was not what I'd refer to as super breathable, nor have any others that I've tried. I'm a real Goldilocks when it comes to finding a good lightweight jacket. I tend to burn up in everything I try. The Micro Climate Jacket nailed it though. 

Function: Cuts the wind. Keeps you warm. Breaths insanely well. I was actually able to keep this jacket on and zipped up during some early morning climbs and even during a few interval sessions on mornings that were in the low 50's. Thats rather remarkable. Its perfect for long descents and early/chilly starts in anything from about 45-60F. It'll keep you dry in dew/fog and light or short rain burst...and most of all it doesn't build up condensation inside. 

While its not the world's most compact jacket (I assume partially due to the heavier weight zipper), I do really like that if folds up into its own pocket. I find it a little too bulky for a jersey pocket, so I either stuff in it an empty water bottle cage or use the MacGyver Strap (sold separate) to affix it under my top tube on two bottle rides. That solution works out pretty well. 

Fit: I'm 5'10"" long torso, 148lbs, 37"" Chest, 30"" Waist and I stuck with an XS even though the size chart put me in a Small...and I'm glad I sized down. The material is super stretchy and I don't like my kit to flap around or bunch up. There's plenty of room for a lightweight LS jersey, and base layer underneath. Shoulders and chest feel good. The neck is perfect (often an issue for me on smaller sizes), and the sleeves are more than long enough. In fact, I feel like they are a little too long. 

The colors are take it or leave it. I missed the train on the Sage, and would have liked to have seen a little bit more vibrant shade of blue, but its still very classy and neutral. The yellow is just a little too much for me though. 

Its a spendy piece of kit, but well worth it. Its definitely a quality investment that will pay returns on the bike for seasons to come.",4.0,micro climate jacket - stone blue,Extra Small,"5'10"", 148lbs.",2022,Jackets/Vests,x small

897,mark m.,2021-12-30,United States,5.0,Awesome Micro Climate Jacket,"In a nutshell - I love this jacket. Used it for the first time here in the Los Angeles basin. Temps started in the mid 40's and I had a thermal long-sleeved base layer, a vest, and the Micro Climate Jacket. Worked up a sweet but the breathability of the jacket handled it just fine. Eventually ditched the vest. I'm not a ""race fit"" rider by any stretch of the imagination, 205lbs at 5'10"" so I ordered the 2XL. A little long in the sleeves but not a big deal. Fit great around the torso and easily handled that layers I had under it. Would a ""relaxed"" fit or fat guy version fit better, sure, but this thing works so great I don't really care. I tried wearing it around town in short sleeves and I never had that clammy feel that's common with a shell. This is going to be a go to item for temps in the mid 50's and below from now on. Packs so small it easily fits in a back pocket or a 1L handlebar bag.

This would make a cool around town hoody for casual use (non biking) on cool days where there's a chance of rain- just saying. Oh in a relaxed fit or course.",,micro climate jacket 2021 - morocco,X-Large,,2021,Jackets/Vests,x large

908,Lawrence L.,2021-12-13,United States,5.0,Fuzzy dots really work,"I recently had the chance to test out this jacket on a ride with temps that started in the low 40s and climbed into the mid-50s. The inside of the jacket has a bunch of fuzzy dots that in addition to feeling soft and luxurious against your skin create a thin air layer to help with insulation and moisture management. It sounded a bit gimicky for what otherwise looked like an expensive long sleeve jersey, but a friend really liked his and I've had good success with past Ornot products. The little dots actually work. I sweat a lot. This jacket performed magnificently, but for some reason the back of the jacket doesn't have the dots. Wouldn't having the dots in the back also help with breathability? I was between this and a Shakedry. I passed on the Shakedry because I don't get much rain. My top priorities were breathability and packability. My Rapha wind jacket seems to pack a tiny bit smaller but this Micro Climate does a much better job breathing. I do wish it came with the standard 3 pockets in the back. I'm 5'6"", 150lb and got the medium. I think the medium was a good call since the original plan was to layer it and use it like a jacket. I think it'd work great by itself too or with a base layer. The material has a nice thin stretch to it. I hope it holds up long term.",3.0,micro climate jacket 2021 - morocco,Medium,"5'6""",2021,Jackets/Vests,medium
909,Colin S.,2021-12-08,United States,4.0,Pretty great piece of kit,"I've only had a couple of chances to use this jacket but both times it impressed. Stretchy, sufficiently long in the sleeves, and decently warm for its small size. Jury is still out on if this is redundant or complementary to my wind vest, as it packs down to just about the same size and is maybe only slightly warmer for your core (breaths very well), but at the very least it is nice to know that the micro climate offers greater overall protection in the cold damp months. The morocco color perfectly toes the line between visibility and playing nice with some of my other kit. It looks great with navy bibs and an orange thermal, for example. Have only received compliments. As mentioned, I had to size down from my regular size (small) for a perfect-to-snug fit over a base layer and thermal jersey. 

Besides the sizing, my one quibble is that the two-way zipper is nice, but the bottom zip doesn't ""lock"" into the end position as well as I'd like. That is, it doesn't take much force to get the zipper to unseat itself so it can start unzipping upwards. I imagine that would be pretty annoying if it inadvertently happened on a ride. Hasn't happened yet, maybe will never happen, but I just noticed it wasn't as locked-in as my other pieces with two-way zips, such as my Voler vest.",3.0,micro climate jacket 2021 - morocco,Extra Small,"5'11"", 135 lbs",2021,Jackets/Vests,x small
915,David G.,2021-12-06,United States,5.0,Strikes the right balance,"On a hilly foggy morning ride, with descents and climbs, and temps in the 50s, the jacket did a great job at keeping me both warm and ventilated; wearing a LS light jersey underneath. As the morning progressed, I was able to keep the jacket on until it got well into the 60s and the sun came out. You might be thinking it's nuts to spend this much on a windbreaker, but it's much more than a plastic shell: there's attentive placement of tiny fleece on the interior, and the exterior fabric and stretch panel eliminate flapping. The double zip is an excellent feature, and it baffles me why so many vests and jackets don't use it.

Only minor issue is the zipper garage at the bottom of the jacket. Riding with full fingered gloves makes it hard to find by feel the small zipper pull tucked into the garage, and the garage makes it hard to zip up the jacket from fully unzipped. I appreciate the minimalism of having small tabs without pulls, but in this case the tabs could have been a touch bigger, or the bottom garage could be eliminated.

Very happy with the purchase. I sized down, making for a more race-cut fit. The stretch keeps it comfortable and snug.",3.0,micro climate jacket - stone blue,Small,"5'10, 155",2021,Jackets/Vests,small

917,Eric S.,2021-11-30,United States,4.0,Almost Perfect,"Lives up to the promise in my experience so far. The fabric has been super comfy throughout all kinds of weather. If I put this on, I usually won't take it off the whole ride unless the temps rise to 70-ish and the sun is shining bright. If I start building up heat, I just zip up the bottom zip. Zip down on the descent.

My main gripe is the fit. The shoulders fit sorta boxy and peak upward when I'm riding. That ends up shortening the sleeves which ride up behind my wrists. The construction leaves something to be desired at this price point I think. Seams are tidy, but not as confidence-inspiring as other jackets I've had around the same price.

933,jeff h.,2021-11-22,United States,5.0,"Form, fit and Function - Check","This jacket is exactly what I wanted. The fabric has a tremendous amount of stretch and wind resistance. It is also highly breathable as there is no laminate. Because of the weave (tightness) it is also quite wind resistant. Moisture repellent is adequate as it relies on treatment at the yarn or fiber level. Either way, moisture beads up and shed off the fabric. 

Fit is like a race fit lightweight LS long sleeve jersey. I use a LS base layer over the SS sleeve work jersey. There is still some room if I wanted a full thermal jersey underneath. The fit though is more jersey than jacket. Perfect for spring and fall weather where conditions change quickly and needs to pack down in key pocket when temps warm up. 

Dual zippers!!! Which means ultimate temp regulations without parachute affect or full unzip!

Pocket is easily accessible but not hearty pocket quick because of zipper. Ample room for phone, etc…

The pattern of the fabric is a great touch, not sure about the insulating factor because of how spaced it is, but it does add enough touch point to add a feel factor. It does feel great against the skin keeping any clammy feeling at bay without full laminated fleece. 

The color is definitely sage, the pics give it more of gray look, but it is sage.

The material is stretchy, windproof as far as I can tell, and it feels good against bare arms. The little dots inside seem to work well for warmth, and the two-way zipper is a must. When it gets colder I'll wear it over long sleeves or arm warmers. I haven't tested it in the rain but it's not a rain jacket; that said I bet it'd be okay for light or intermittent rain. I like it instead of arm warmers and a vest for early mornings--when you know it'll warm-up. It packs up reasonably small--it fits in a jersey pocket.

1017,Andrew L.,2021-09-30,United States,5.0,Fantastic Piece for Micro Climates or Just as a Jacket!,"As the name of the product suggests, this jacket is perfect for micro climates. I'm in the SF Bay Area and this jacket works perfectly for heading out the door on those relatively chilly mornings (mid-50s) where later on it might be a bit warmer (low to mid-60s). 

I typically wear mine with a Ornot House Jersey and a thin baselayer underneath. Despite this, the jacket is breathable enough that I don't overheat while climbing.

I was caught out in some light rain (first rain of the season) just after buying this jacket. With a light enough rain, the water just beads up on the surface of the jacket. However, it's important to note this jacket is NOT waterproof as stated by Ornot. Once enough moisture saturates the jacket, it'll start to wet out. The Magic Shell, which I intend to eventually order, will be much better suited for that.

Size wise, I wear a size small in Ornot's House Jerseys, which provides me a not too tight but not too loose fit. If anything it skews towards a tighter race fit, but still remains comfortable. For the Micro Climate Jacket, I initially ordered a size small which felt very roomy with only a jersey and baselayer underneath. Most notably, there was a lot of room in the shoulder and upper arm area. The material used on this jacket doesn't really flap in the wind, but I wanted something a bit tighter. I went to the Ornot store and the guy there was super helpful to convince me to size down to a Extra Small which fits way better. Excess material on the shoulder area has been cut down. Because of the stretchiness of the material, the body doesn't feel tight at all. If you intend to wear relatively light layers underneath (like a jersey and baselayer), I would recommend sizing down. If you intend to wear a heavier layer(s) and/or long sleeve jersey underneath, I would recommend sticking to your usual size.",3.0,micro climate jacket - stone blue,Small,"5'6"" 135lbs",2021,Jackets/Vests,small

But, although lean and as a lifelong surfer and swimmer, my shoulders can represent problems with fit. The narrow shoulder width made for a tight fit, so I returned it. Not ornot’s fault. The torso and arm length were perfect, though. Typically, Ornot, the materials and design are top notch. And Ben’s customer service is unparalleled and next level. Just super!

I exchanged it for a small and the fit of the body is great, nice and aero, but the sleeves are just a bit short on me. I'm going to keep the small, but it's a bit odd that the sleeves on this are short when the small thermal has sleeves that are a perfect length on the bike.

1088,Spencer C.,2021-06-10,United States,5.0,I call it the magic climate jacket,"When my microclimate (MC) arrived, I was caught of guard by the petiteness of the packaging. About the size of a Castanza wallet, it was a noticeably small piece of kit that would be easily packable as advertised. I am often ambivalent about certain brand sizing and can be caught in between medium and large depending on brand. After reading reviews, I went with medium. Fit was perfect! I am 6’ and 168 lbs, with a muscular upper body. My first impression was the material seemed light and I questioned the noted temperature range. I love the lack of branding and another main reason I invest in the Ornot brand. Back to temperature: on my first ride, I took a leap and wore the MC over an Ornot thermal jersey with a non-sleeved base layer. My phone said it was 50 degrees at the start of 6 am ride pre-work ride, in coastal Santa Barbara. Throughout the ride the temp varied from 48-53. MC performed beautifully. Not cold at the start and not too hot as the ride progressed. I was impressed! Traditionally, I wear a gilet in this situation, so not having arm chill at ride start was nice. At the conclusion of the ride, the base layer was not damp, which demonstrates the breathabilty of the material. No flapping at an 18-21 mph pace with Max speeds in upper 20’s. I was able to access my phone in the rear pocket with full fingered gloved hands. I also appreciate the dual zipper upgrade. Overall, super impressed and suggest they change the name to the “magic climate” jacket, Ornot, as I also own the magic shell, but believe I will get more use out of this piece of kit in the situations I am most often encountering in the coastal and mountainous local rides.",3.0,micro climate jacket - sage,Medium,6’ 168,2021,Jackets/Vests,medium

It is very comfortable to wear and extremely verstile. I have worn in it in many conditions including very light rain and tried it in many diffrent layering options inclduing with my Ornot merino thermal jersey. It performed flawlessly and I love how it packs down. My only complaint is that it does seem to be a little big in the shoulders so when over the bars, it bunches up and flaps a bit. Due to the material, it isnt loud though. I thought I might be in between sizes but I went with the same size as my thermal jersey which is spot on. This isnt a deal breaker but I would have liked it to fit more snug especially because the fabric has so much stretch so you can still layer if needed.

1159,WELLINGTON W.,2021-02-05,United States,4.0,"Great addition to my growing collection of kit, ornot","While i've only gotten to use the MicroClimate jacket on one ride so far (it's a bit too cold most mornings in New Jersey right now) it fared extremely well for a 35 degree, sunny day, w/ a long-sleeve base layer and short sleeve jersey underneath. The jacket looks great and feels well made. I'll be curious about durability and would be hesitant to take it on a trail ride as the fabric is relatively thin. 

The reason i'm giving it 4 stars vs. 5 is because the fit isn't quite perfect for me. I'm somewhat in between sizes with Ornot as the L vest I have is on the snug side (fortunately the material stretches) even though I prefer a more aero/race type fit and the XL is a bit too loose around my arms and midsection.

1232,Jeffrey C.,2020-12-16,United States,5.0,Best in Class!,"I've never been a fan of rain jackets, preferring to use a vest when wind was a factor, and avoiding riding when rain is in the forecast. With this Micro Climate jacket, however, my approach to riding in windy and sketchy forecast conditions has changed, especially given the fact the weather forecasts seem to have gotten less accurate the harder they try.

I love the breathability of this jacket. I am a heavy sweater, so to use this jacket and not have a build up of moisture after long, hard rides is saying a lot. I've ridden in this jacket in 45° temps with a LS base and thermal jersey up to 60° with a short sleeve jersey and have been very comfortable, with no overheating, and not being too chilly. My rides vary from 20 to 50 miles.

So, this jacket goes with me on every ride now, even if it's only stashed in my frame bag. I ride all winter here in West Virginia, and this has been a welcome addition to my fall/winter kit.

In future iterations I would love to see brighter color choices (orange is my favorite fall/winter color vs. hi-vis yellow) and a two-way zipper.

Starting ride temps in the mid 40's and finish temps in the mid 60's - the jacket breathes so well in that range that I never felt the need to take it off. It kept me comfortable.

I have to say I was very impressed. The little insulation triangles actually seemed to work and this breathed better than anything of the like I have ever worn. This really excelled when I zipped it all the way down for a climb and then all the way back up for a decent. For sure, the best value piece of winter kit I own.

Like everyone else has said, a bottom zipper would make this 5 stars. I would buy another one in a heart beat if there was a hi vis color and would also buy this as a vest.

1248,Naz H.,2020-12-09,United States,5.0,"Well, this changed my opinion on wind jackets...","Generally, I've never been into wind jackets. I love to layer and have become particular about what combo of layers I use to regulate temperature. Vests have long been my go-to, and the Ornot Magic Shell has been the perfect softshell-like jersey-jacket that brings you over the edge when you need to stay warm and protect from the elements. Between the two, I can layer down or up or do merino/poly or synthetic jersey combos with appropriate baselayers. I fell in love with the Powerwool thermal jerseys Ornot introduced last year, and prefer that jersey over the synthetic ones. The LS lightweight is a good jersey but I find myself a little cool in that one. I love the thermal jersey so much but that paired with a Magic Shell can be too toasty in the shoulder seasons. 

I live in San Francisco, so when I heard about this Micro Climate jacket and that Ornot is also based out of SF, I knew this would be interesting. So what did they do? They made a stretchy but absolutely fitted wind jacket that packs into its own pocket, and has little 1-2mm low-profile soft fleece pattern that matches their design on the inside that provides a touch of insulation and a lovely handfeel on your arms (if they're bare). I've now worn this jacket with the lightweight SS house jersey and my beloved thermal jersey and that 40-60º swing is easily managed. Bonus for the packability again, so if you do get toasty, you can stash it in a rear pocket or handlebar bag or strap it to your bike unlike the Magic Shell which while slim, is not as easily packable. You can bring this jacket along just for insurance. 

I wanted to give this 4.5 stars (but you can't with these reviews) because my only wish is a double zipper for heat management, but because I've now become a wind jacket convert, I'm down for the 5.",,micro climate jacket - sage,,,2020,Jackets/Vests,No size provided by reviewer

Oh, and the inside has this soft, textured pattern that keeps the jacket from sticking to your skin when you warm up, providing far better thermoregulation than I was expecting from a wind jacket.

So the basic construction is just as good, but I’m afraid that it is a too simplistic approach… Other long tights are made up of several patches of different weight materials, and I think this is for a good reason.

1292,Charlie,2023-03-09,United States,5.0,Bossy Bibs,"These bibs are absolutely dialed. I wanted some bibs to really thrash this winter, and decided to try out the Ornots because they checked a lot of boxes — no ****** branding, good colors, cargo pockets, wool blend, straps don't go over nips. I got some mediums, which were suggested for my height and weight, but my thunder thighs barely fit. I swapped them for the larges — super easy, Ornot CS is dialed. The larges fit perfectly.

The construction is top notch. They are strong and cozy. I have ridden them on big gravel rides where they get completely saturated, but keep you warm. I have ridden them on mountain bike rides and crashed at higher speeds sliding over rocks and sticks, no rips or tears. I have also ridden them on chilly road rides where they also shine. These have seen trailwork days in the muck on hands and knees moving rocks and running chainsaws. We are talking about conditions from 28º and sunny to 33º and pouring. These things handle it all. If you know it's going to be REALLY cold, I would throw some shorts or pants over to help with some extra warmth, but for the most part these are amazing.

I have been riding 3-5 times a week this winter in these, washing them after each ride. They have held up insanely well. Most ""premium"" products start to show signs of wear when you wash them all the time — losing elasticity, fraying ends, stitching coming loose, like my pearl izumi gear. These are still as minty fresh as the day I bought them. They even do a good job of killing odors, thanks to the wool blend I would guess. Only problem is that they sold out before I could get my hands on the blue ones. :(

Anyway, if you are looking for bibs. Get these, they are insanely good.",,men's thermal cargo bib tight - mesa,,,2023,Bibs/Tights,No size provided by reviewer

I went to their San Francisco location and was able to get all my questions answered by their staff. Everyone was very friendly and willing to go out of their way to assist. 

I tend to be in-between sizes and I often have trouble finding clothes that fit properly. I initially purchased an Extra Large bib. After trying the bib on at home and giving it some second thought, I realized it was too big for me. I contacted Ben in their Customer Service department and he was very helpful and responsive over email. I exchanged the bib for a Large; it fits great and is highly comfortable.

I prefer to buy from small businesses as opposed to larger companies, and I appreciate that they are a company that is climate neutral and is willing to put their money where their mouth is.",,men's cargo bib short - stone blue,Extra Large,,2023,Bibs/Tights,x large

1491,David R.,2023-02-15,United States,5.0,Beautifully Made,"I bought these bibs and a pair of Pactimo cargo bibs at the same time. Pactimo had a big sale and I thought I'd try both. Pactimo's bibs came first and they are quite nice. I'm a little concerned about the size and durability of their outer pockets. They basically stretch around about half the circumference of the leg. I'm not sure I like how loosely they hold items. The bib and chamois both seem to be well made and comfortable.

When I got the Ornot bibs, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the fabric used to make these. This is a high quality fabric. Second, the outer pockets, while not as large as those on Pactimo, are sturdy - and plenty large enough. Nothing is going to fall out of them!

I've only ridden in each once - both about 3 hour rides. They are both good. But I would say the Ornot chamois just feels like it is going to be comfortable for almost any length ride. I have the BWR AZ Wafer coming up in a couple weeks. At this point, I plan to ride on the Ornots. If something changes, I will update this review. But for now, I would strongly recommend the Ornot bibs.

The style of these bibs, like all of the ORNOT products, is ultimately why I bought them and appreciate them. Only used them for a couple fo rides so far, but my only real issue is the fit though front of the hips/groin. As time goes by on the ride, the fabric tends to bunch up in this area and start to constrict and rub. A smaller size is not an option as these were plenty tight. A bigger size would be too loose everywhere else and likely lead to more bunching. I've owned a lot of bibs and have never noticed this before.

1499,Kyle H.,2023-01-03,United States,3.0,"Fantastic design and fit, bit exposed stitching makes these bibs less than perfect","I ride mostly gravel with a fair bit of that focused on fast bike packing and ultra endurance races. I purchased the Ornot Cargo Bib Shorts hoping to use them for that purpose. I've ridden about 1,000 kms in them over the past few weeks and here are some quick thoughts:

I really like the design and fit. The proportions of the size small are excellent for my body (5'10"" and 70kgs). The length and compression is spot on for my preferences. The pockets are well designed - right size and the band at the top provides security. Initially, the chamois seemed a bit thick compared to what I topically use, but I've found it very comfortable for long days >200kms on both rough and smooth roads.

My primary recommendation for improvement is in the stitching. The bibs are composed of many panels and the construction does not use flat lock stitching leaving quite a bit of material and stitches exposed in the interior of the bibs. This has caused chafing and discomfort, especially in the area between the front hip and the top of the quadricep where the material folds during pedal strokes. Removing the bibs left impressions and irritated skin in these areas. I have used chamois cream/butter to lesson the effects, but it's a less than ideal solution. I wasn't bothered by the other areas of the bibs where exposed material and stitching were present.

I hope that Ornot can address this in future iterations of the bibs, because there design has a lot of potential to be an excellent option for ultra endurance on/off-road riders.",,cargo bib short - black,Small,,2023,Bibs/Tights,small

1517,Don,2022-10-22,United States,3.0,"Pocket mesh, chamois could be better","I love Ornot’s mission and values, their product line always looks great, and I was excited to try my first pair of their bibs. Out of the package, the olive cargo bibs looked great. The green was even better than pictured. Sizing was spot on. They felt great on. The straps are amazing. 

On my second ride, however, the mesh of one of the leg pockets tore. I had stored my phone in the pocket, and the mesh fabric was not sturdy enough to handle my it (maybe stick with gloves or snacks for the pockets). 

After several uses, I’ve also found these bibs to chafe the inside-front of my thighs. The sides of the chamois toward the front have some flat fabric that extend much wider than the chamois fabric on all of my other bibs, and it’s this fabric that’s causes the chafing (even when using chamois cream). The rest of the chamois is really top notch. It’s too bad, though, because I really wanted to love these and round out my cycling wardrobe with some additional Ornot bibs.",,cargo bib short - dark olive,Large,,2022,Bibs/Tights,large

Despite doing a bunch of research on cargo bib offerings from other brands, I'm so glad I decided on these Ornot Cargo Bibs. Literally my first ride on them was on an organized century ride. The side pockets were extremely helpful during this ride, where I stashed the cue sheet on one pocket for quick and easy reference and some snacks on the other pocket. Zero discomfort from these during the entire 100+ miles and 6k+ ft elevation gain. Size-wise, they're on par with those from popular brands. I usually wear a size small in other brands and went with a small for these. They fit me quite well, although there are some things to note. First, the leg inseam is a tad longer than bibs from other brands, but there's enough give in the material to pull them up a bit and maintain those tan lines. Second, the bib straps are pretty long even though I have a long torso. No issues with them in the riding position, but they are loose when I'm off the bike (standing or sitting straight up). Not a showstopper, but hope Ornot takes this into account on the next iteration. The chamois is somewhat thick, but this is expected for an endurance bib.

However, I had a few friends that had these bibs and they came highly recommended so I took a chance and gave these a shot - I’m sure glad I did!

This pad starts out feeling so thick that you don’t even feel the saddle, effectively changing your seat height, but then seems to compress as you ride. I have yet to take them on a really long ride, but suspect that they are going in the wrong direction.

Had an R pair with good pockets that went to early body fabric failure + I was never 100% on the pad. A PI pair were a disaster in most ways, after several rides falling out of rotation and soon getting discarded. 7M makes an excellent pair, one of my go-tos for long unsupported rides, but unfortunate that without banding it can be tough to find the pocket entrances with full finger gloves.

I like the ornot brand, they are local to my area and do their best to keep everything local. That being said, I wasn't a big fan of their house bibs, I wasn't a fan of that chamois - it's fine. Just not for me. I took a chance with getting these as they state they redesigned their chamois. I after some good rides, I -really- like them. The only caveat I have is it feels like the straps are a bit long, they work - they just feel a tiny bit loose. They completely work, just different from the other walton-owned brand I use.

For anyone with the House Bibs the new endurance pad is about 50% more thick and twice as firm. It was marginally warmer to wear indoors on the turbo trainer with the pockets blocking a small amount of ventilation on their own and I'd imagine that only get worse when you start throwing food and gels into them.

With the fiber blend you get anti stink, excellent moisture wicking and insulation properties with the added durability from the synthetic. Versatile in a wide range of temps is what I wanted and this fills that void. I am pairing this with a thin sleeveless or short sleeve base layer, but it has room for a long sleeve one as well when it’s much colder here in MN. The outer layer is either the magic shell or microclimate jacket. Both of which are superb and create one of the best clothing systems I have put together. My two complaints are the robust zipper garages and the rear pocket positioning. Zipper garage make it a pain to fully zip up after being completely unzipped to dump heat while still pedaling. The garage especially the bottom one is thick because of the fabric. Keep the top one but omit the button on next gen version. The biggest complaint is the high pockets on the back.

1809,Allan R.,2022-01-11,United States,5.0,"Great fit, better than previous version","This is my second one of these, and Ornot has improved the fit and function. The previous version had extremely long sleeves, to the point where it would bunch up quite a bit at the wrists. The sleeves are a better length on this version. Also the fit is a bit more fitted, as compared to the older version. The previous version wasn't loose, but this one is definitely more snug for a more streamlined look. Lastly, the zipper is a bit easier to use, the previous version had a zipper with smaller teeth that was a bit more ""sticky"", this one uses larger teeth and is easier to zip/unzip with one hand. The one change I'm not totally sold on is it seems the pockets are a bit smaller (size of opening). I haven't measured it, but it just feels a bit more difficult to put in and retrieve things from the pockets. Not impossible, and generally I prefer items in the pocket to be secure, rather than moving around, but they do seem a bit narrow.

The fit is pretty trim, I'd say it's a race fit but the material is stretchy enough that it doesn't feel tight. 

5'7"" at 150lbs ordered a Medium (one size up from my usual as suggested)

My only complaints are that the sleeves are a bit long as I'm short, but all jersey's have this problem on me. The pocket could use a zipper and the pockets themselves could be bigger. 

One upgrade to consider is some sort of different thinner material on the pits for extra pit breathability.

My days of long winter base miles are well behind me, but this jersey has renewed my enthusiasm for bagging those late-season rides in the high country before the snow starts falling and the AT skis come out.

My only constructive criticism for Ornot is: make the sleeves a tad longer for us lanky folks so there's not a gap from glove to cuff, and consider jettisoning the folded fabric bit on the lower zipper; it doesn't add much value and makes it awkward to engage.

Note: I wear a small in Ornot SS and lightweight LS jerseys, and ordered a medium in this. It does indeed run a full size (or maybe a little more) on the small side, so order accordingly.",2.0,merino thermal jersey - sage,Medium,"5'11"", 143lb",2021,Jerseys,medium

I was familiar with Polertec PowerWool so I was really interested to see how it worked in a jersey.I have been riding in mainly dry, cool/colder and windy conditions mainly in mornings when it starts out very cold and warms up. Here in Southern Cal that means mid 40's all the way up to low 60's along with around 50, cloudy and windy and a little damp. I have worn it solo, as well as with a sleeve less base and also with a wind vest. It performed supurbly on all those rides. The product wicks pretty darn good and retains its warmth but you don't overheat even up in the low 60's. The other thing that I love about this is that unlike wool, it is nice and stretchy but doesnt loose its shape so it fits right next to skin all the time. I am 5'11'' and 158 and the MED fits me perfect. It seems super tight when you put it on but once you are on the bike and moving around its perfect all the time. Great job Ornot, this is an iconic piece for sure. I would buy another today if you had it in other colors besides Coyote.

With a vest, and an appropriate base layer, the jersey definitely allows for a wide variance in temperature. On high tempo days, go a little lighter, and on slower slog days, go with a heavier base layer and more layers on top.

I’m impressed with the Polartec Powerwool this far. Definitely a fabric to watch. 

The fit is my favorite. Unlike some other jerseys, with saggy pockets, this is fitted close to the body in the lower back.

1991,Todd P.,2023-06-22,United States,5.0,Put it to the Test,"This is a top-notch all-weather jersey. Bought it ahead of a 2-day, 200-mile trip last November. Ended up a 1-day, 150-mile ride with a 30-degree temperature swing. 

If you’ve ever been to Georgia, you know the weather can be unpredictable in the fall. When we set out it was overcast and in the high 50s F. The day warmed to around 70F and I never overheated. Because the next day’s weather called for a near-freezing start and I forgot my tail bag (with my OrNot magic shell) back home, we called an audible and turned around at mile 75. 

That afternoon, temps dipped to low 40s and with only a too-big light rain shell over top I managed to stay warm so long as we were pedaling. Feel like I tested the full capabilities of this jersey. It breathes extremely well, but effectively traps heat such that a wind shell or gilet over top turns it into great insulation. Fit is close but not race, and I find a small fits me well (5’9”, 145-155lbs, 32” sleeves). Sleeves are not too long, unlike Rapha pro. Pockets are adequately deep without being hard to reach, and sturdy given the hardier material. Construction is good with no loose threads or missed stitches that I saw. 

I wear this when I don’t know what the weather will be. I also loan it out to friends who don’t ride regularly and don’t want to look or feel like a pretend pro. I wear Rapha Pro or OrNot, and choose OrNot for all my weather gear (outerwear, gloves, leg warmers, etc.).

It has a double zipper, so easy to regulate temperature and easy to get into your jersey pockets (check).

2058,Upcountry,2022-12-30,,5.0,Ornot know best...,"The Micro Climate Jacket was my introduction to Ornot two years ago, and I've since added a dozen or so pieces. I had actually emailed the crew last year with a request that they offer a ""Micro Climate Gilet"", and even back then they informed me that it was in the works. So the day this launched, I was on-board, even with being a bit caught offguard by the fabric choices. As Zviki mentions in their review, this isn't merely a sleeveless version of the Micro Climate Jacket, and thats the right move, despite me thinking that was what I wanted. 
A vest is typically an ""in-between"" piece for when the weather might not warrant a full jacket, but you need to cut a bit of wind over a jersey. The beauty of the combination of Micro Climate fabric and the grid fleece panels is that you don't give up too much in terms of wind blocking ability, and breathability, but you do gain the option of using this as an insulating layer under a shell. Thus making this piece just a bit bulkier than a pure wind gilet, but also far more versatile. I've owned a Polartec Alpha gilet from the big R, and this piece is really similar in its use, although I might say the Ornot will be warmer when used under a shell.
My only critique would be the color blocking/stitching on the Morocco isn't too appealing, but the Stone Blue is subtle and classy, and I've got no doubt other great colors will come in time.

My only critique would be the color blocking/stitching on the Morocco isn't too appealing, but the Stone Blue is subtle and classy, and I've got no doubt other great colors will come in time.

2060,Zviki,2022-12-28,United States,5.0,As good as a vest can get,"I have the original microclimate jacket since it first came out, so was really excited about it, ordered as soon it was available. This is nothing like the jacket, though. The front is similar but the back has this fine breathable ""grid"" that feels so nice. Just picking it up, everything feels like premium quality. Tried it on a couple of rides now, 40-30s paired with a good base layer and a thin jersey. These were group rides, with plenty of effort to make me sweat. This vest is just outstanding. I didn't feel cold at any point, and I didn't feel like I'm getting drenched in there, either. When stopping, it evaporates quickly and was overly wet. Another great point is that the arms has nice elastic rubber that ensures they don't flap when descending, because nobody likes a flappy vest.

Packing it half way was simple, and it's small enough to fit in a jersey pocket. It does have itss own pockets and doesn't have the nice zippered pocket like the jacket. The pockets are nice and they feel like jersey pockets. I'm not sure I need them, since I normally like to option to take the vest off without stopping, and that won't work with stuff in the vest pockets. It's still nice to have, e.g. for a phone. If I had to think of something to improve: maybe add an opening on each side to allow easy access to the jersey pockets and have those zippered for venting when needed. 

Overall, this is an amazing vest. It's warm enough to work down to the freezing temps with a base layer, it's not bulky, it breaths really well, and I generally prefer a vest over a jacket, unless it's raining. I'm very happy with my purchase.",,micro climate vest - stone blue,Medium,,2022,Jackets/Vests,medium

What really surprised me though is how warm this jersey is. Most of the reviews and descriptions talk about its breathability and how cool it is but I wore it for the first time yesterday on a 70º F fall evening and it was verging on being uncomfortably warm. The fabric felt more like a thin sweater than a performance cycling jersey, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but just wasn't expected.

I’ve had poor experiences with long sleeve jerseys in the past, they’re usual nice when just pedaling along but as soon as you start to put in work, I quickly over heat. So I normal go with short sleeves and arm warmers. Today was sunny but chilly in the low 50’s. I started out warm and stayed warm nearly the whole ride, I paired it with ornot’s vest and a sleeveless base layer, I was so stoked on the temperature control and how well this top breathes. I never felt sweaty just comfortable. As the sun went down I could have used the microclimate jacket but I wasn’t terribly uncomfortable, my core was warm but I could’ve done with a windbreak for the arms.

2201,Mark S.,2022-04-11,United States,5.0,Great Item for me,"This is essential a heavyweight thermal undergarment for colder weather riding. I have worn it three times with a short- sleeve jersey over top in the lower 40s to mid 50s. It provides some (not a lot) wind break, but certainly very breathable. I LOVE:
1. the weights and fabric - soft. clings nicely.
2. Zipper is excellent, even little tuck at bottom of zipper - quality touch.
3. The bottom has an excellent silicon/rubbery circumference and holds very well to my bibs so it doesn't hike up or move around when I do even over a several hour ride.
4. The color is unique, rich, awesome! Hook 'Em Horns!
5. It is a slightly cropped fit, which is perfect for me since I am a little short wasted. It does not stick out under a jersey or jacket on the bottom. A very neat look!

The sizing chart is excellent. I am 5' 10"" and about 205lbs. I ordered the XL to be a ""roomier"" fit. Wise choice. It is clingy and stretchy so really you cant go wrong ordering up a size unless you had narrow shoulders. Also, no matter the quality, and this is a very high quality piece, all jerseys will shrink a tad after a hundred washes, so that gives you some upside.

(just as an aside, I also got the micro climate yellow jacket. I ordered XXL - another wise choice. I can wear some thicker layers under it, as well as just a short sleeve jersey.)",3.0,grid thermal jersey - mars,Extra Large,"5' 10"" 205 LBS",2022,Jerseys,x large

One caveat that doesn't detract from their overall rating is that even though these fit my waist well and as advertised, the fabric on these do stretch and sag slightly, especially when the pockets are full. In short, these pants should have a belt.

The fabric weight is hefty enough to hold their waist, they're sewn in the US, and phone/leg pocket is really useful. The stretch is significant, the taper makes them easy to keep out of of the chainrings, and the zippers are robust. I bought two pairs and as long as I keep up with laundry I'm probably wearing them most days. I will promote what another reviewer said: consider going up a size in the inseam. I'm almost always a 32 inseam and these were breaking above my ankle bone.

The rear pockets are very well angled, and I appreciate the extra mid-leg pocket too for storing more essentials. Can be a little dressy or casual as required.

Sizing aside, they great for commutes, airports and travel days, road trips. I’m actually taking these on an upcoming multi day backpacking trip since they’re so light and dry out quickly.

2324,Zach,2023-06-22,United States,5.0,Best pants ever,"I want to start this off by saying I'm very critical of pants thanks to having huge thighs and calves. If they fit one, they rarely fit the other (e.g. fits in the thighs, but now they're basically bellbottoms at the ankle), but a tear came to my eye that after literally searching for years I finally found some pants that fit perfect. 

I've put these pants through their paces, and they've held up beautifully. Everything from office commutes through terrible weater, a few trail rides through the countryside, and grabbing beers at the bar after, they've done it all in style. 

They offer plenty of mobility in the crotch, loads of pockets (huge fan of the zipper back back pocket to remove the anxiety of my work badge or wallet falling out), and they're breathable enough I'm willing to wear them out in the absolutely crushing summer heat in Texas. 

In addition to the use on the bike, they also look great off the bike and in casual settings. I'm not a huge fan of pants with a thigh pocket, but the one on these bad lads is discrete, and perfectly functional when on the bike. 

10/10 - highly recommend. I have a couple pairs in different colors, and will be slowly replacing pants in the wardrobe once other colors come back in stock.",,men's mission pants - mesa,36x34,,2023,Shorts/Pants,36x34

They look great, the zippered pockets are super handy, they've been durable to bike commuting and other wear-and-tear, they still look good after suffering some sweat and movement, and they're flexi through the thigh.

I loved this from the first time I put it on, and I still love it now, more than two years along. If the sun was out, and it was warmer than ~60° F, then this is what I was wearing on the bike (sometimes with a base layer underneath). In the 30s F, then this underneath a Magic Shell works great for me.

If I could have the arms just a bit longer - perhaps 1"" - I would. I understand, though, that that's getting into the realm of not practically being able to fit every body perfectly; my arms are just a little bit on the long side.

Aside from the excellent functionality, I love the low-key aesthetic.

The Gravel color is a very-slightly-cool/neutral gray as opposed to the Coastal Lead version which is pretty much baby-blue. This one is the one you want if you like the photos of Coastal Lead and hope you're getting a silvery-gray jersey.

Pockets feel secure. Stitching is strong - it has a nice amount of stretch for how thin it feels. The black version has nice subtle blue details.
Would have loved a zip pocket even if it added a few more bucks. 
Breathes extremely well - I wore it over Craft LS active extreme baselayer and under a wind vest and it was good in 45 to 55 degrees.

2943,D. Arnott,2020-06-15,United States,5.0,"Great Jersey -- Buy it, Ornot","Overall, I recommend this piece of kit. It would be a nice addition to any collection. I, for one, am glad to have it even though I did not really need it as my cycling wardrobe is already tightly curated. However, I was intrigued by the claim that, depending on the base layer, it could satisfy any ride between 40-80 degrees. And while I have not tested it at the low end of 40, I do believe the claim is true. I tested four different base layers (a Giordana sleeveless, an Assos Spring/Fall short sleeve, a Rapha ProTeam lightweight short sleeve, an Assos summer long sleeve) and I am sure my Assos long sleeve Spring/Fall base layer would work with this jersey for a 40 degree ride. The main thing is to dial it in. 

Originally, I thought I would provide a review of each base layer tested under different riding conditions, but I realize that I run a bit cold and my preference is to dress up (I would rather be too warm than too cold) and that what works for me won’t necessarily work for everyone. Body temperature and comfort may just be as specific as a finger print. In any case, here are a few considerations:

The jersey does not wick away sweat well and therefore acts like a sort of air-conditioner. Basically, without a base layer to remove sweat away from your skin, the jersey lets in air without letting out moister and the result is a cooling effect. This is a good thing and a bad thing, depending. On a hot day, it makes for a nice warm breeze if you can keep your speed up. In fact, this quality is a sort of motivator as you got to keep moving to keep cool. One thing is for sure, I would think twice about using the jersey, with or without a base layer, on a 80 degree day where I would be slogging up some exposed mountain for any length of time. On cooler days or even warm days with that Bay Area wind, the right base layer is essential. If fact, one day I went out in the Rapha Proteam lightweight short sleeve base layer and was fine until I hit Samual P. Taylor. The temperature drops there as it always does and there was a bit of a headwind. For that little stretch it felt like my arms were colder than if they had been bare (my core was fine though). I was glad to reach the coast and even happier to be heading up Bofax. 

The only other consideration is that you got to be careful not to dress up - you don’t want to be in the middle of a ride with the temperature increasing and wishing you could shed a layer with your only options being to strip your jersey or your base layer. Got to check your variable conditions before you suit up. This is not to say that the jersey does not work under viable conditions: I did a ride up to Tam (Assos Summer long sleeve jersey) on one of those days when heading out of the city where I live was in the mid-50s, then heavy with fog and wet all the way up Panoramic until past Pantoll the sun is out and it is 82 degrees heading up to East Peak - I was fine and happy on the descents). 

In short, my recommendation: Buy it and then dial it.",3.0,ls lightweight house jersey - black - xs only,Medium,6 Feet/ 175lbs,2020,Jerseys,medium

A few unsolicited opinions:
1. Sleeves are a bit long for me which cause some minor wrinkles and rolls to form.
2. The extra ""collar"". Not sure why this is needed. It would feel so much better, especially in higher temperatures to remove the extra band of fabric around the collar. In colder temperatures, I can simply layer up.
3. Need to add a small zippered pocket for essentials like cash, cards, and keys. I don't necessarily want to carry my wallet with me on every ride. This is pretty standard on most mid to high end apparel but is missing here. 

Overall though this is a great product and would buy again if more colors were available. I'm looking specifically for beige, maroon, or light grey.",3.0,ls lightweight house jersey - coastal lead,,"5'11"" (180 cm), 180 lbs (82 kg)",2020,Jerseys,No size provided by reviewer

The only basis of comparison on which I have to measure this jersey is against the entry-level Pearl Izumi jerseys from REI and my recently acquired local club kit from Pactimo. The Ornot is the highest tech and best feeling. It’s light, it’s fresh, and it works well. 

I ride with a few people who wear the same Ornot jersey and I’ve seen their portable inflators jump out of their pockets when the gravel gets rough.

It is a snug fit so keeps me honest with my diet (not a bad thing).

The only issue I have is the depth of the pockets. As an example, my phone doesn't sit completely inside the pocket and about 15% of it pokes out the top. As a result I worry about it falling out quite a lot when I'm riding. 

I wear an XS so I am familiar with having smaller pockets. I appreciate that if they're a bit higher they're harder to get into however I'd much rather than scenario than have to worry about the content of the pockets all the time when I ride.

The House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length). It fits closely but not tightly on me and has very little ""zipper bunch"" when on the bike in the drops or hoods. It might be a tad bit better with a fourth zippered pocket for valuables but not necessary and I knew this when I asked for it, among other Ornot items, for my birthday

BTW:
- the Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color let down somewhat by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (this may be due to my height and needing a Medium but no other bib I have is as difficult ))

3482,KTS,2021-04-09,United States,5.0,"Snug, lightweight, comfortable. A few minor gripes.","So far so good with the House Jersey! This is a great summer-weight jersey, and the colors along with subtle texture and design cues really help it stand out from a lot of other jerseys, without relying on neon logos or ostentatious patterns. Front of the jersey is a tighter-weave material than the perforated side and back panels, so the jersey does a great job of shedding heat.

Fit is tight - this is more of a race-cut jersey. Don't expect to wear it with out bibs, otherwise your navel might be hanging out. That being said, you don't have to size up like many European brands.

Functionally, my only complaints are that it would be nice to have one small zippered pocket, and at this price point it would be nice to see laser-cut seams on the sleeves with silicone grippers, as opposed to the rolled-and-sewn construction. But I can't knock a high-quality jersey sewn in the USA, and given the available colors and the overall quality, I'll likely be saving up my beans to purchase another one soon.",3.0,house jersey - coastal burgundy,Medium,"6'1"" (185cm), 170lbs (78kg)",2021,Jerseys,medium

3659,Ryan H.,2020-08-12,United States,5.0,"It's okay to pick favorites, Ornot.","I’m between sizes on the House jerseys, so it's horses for courses: Large fits slightly loose, very comfy and more generous for moving around but gathers up a bit. M is aero-race-fit snug and lays down smooth, good for those purposeful focussed fast days after I've done my push-ups and crunches. It adds at least another 20 watts on the road, Ornot. Like the fantastic bibs, the House jersey materials are super-stretchy and soft, basically disappears once you get moving.

The Morocco color is perfection; not yellow, or mustard, or that safety-neon-green, but somehow all of them together. Looks fantastic tied with the Stone Blue vest and Coastal Bolt Storm sock.

I've used this jersey once after hand washing. I hope it holds up. I don't want to say ""it feels like wearing nothing at all"" because it does and it doesn't. You just don't notice it, it's not pushing and pulling in the wrong places, the zipper doesn't ride up, the neckline doesn't ride up, the selves are just right when on the bike.

Regardless, the quality was really high, love the color and the feel of the material. The sleeve length was perfect. Perforation on the back and sides awesome.

It definitely fit my arms/shoulders (which are broad) but it was just a little too high on my waist. It didn't show my belly, but it just looked like it shrunk in the front. (my wife immediately noticed and thought it looked funny) I ordered the Large and it's about an inch or two longer and fits great. It's still snug on my arms, chest, and stomach, but has the length I was looking for. The House Jersey is tight no matter what size you buy, so neither the M or the L were saggy or loose for me. If anything, the M was like sausage-casing racing tightness, the L was a comfortable tightness, surprisingly with no bunching or extra wrinkles. I went through the same process with the bibs but ended up keeping the Mediums.

I own A LOT of kit; Pedla, Pas Normal, Hunter Bros, Attaquer, Pedal Mafia, Rapha, ENDO Customs, SAS and more...no, seriously, even more - Finch, La Passione, Isadore, God&Famous, Ostroy, MONO, Morvelo...and more. I can honestly say (and this is field tested, multi-brand Owner talking here) ORNOT'S FIT AND FINISH IS UNPARALLELED. IT IS PERFECT, IT IS UNMATCHED AND THE PRICING IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BRAND. And the low key graphics - once considered an alternative to the endlessly ""loud"" offerings which exists, has become the new industry pursuit and now other Brands are chasing ORNOT's minimalist aesthetic which they simply cannot do. Sure, PNS has some cool, low volume graphics based on Skando-design elements BUT THAT AINT NEW and frankly at almost $300 for a F*** PNS Jersey for instance is absolutely ******! And NOTHING compares to the fit of ORNOT - N-O-T-H-I-N-G, I can prove it!

Fit is the same for as many other brands. Maybe slightly tighter than Craft, Louis G but not quite Castelli tight (which causes me to size up). Probably most similar Velocio sizing.

The Ornot brand was exactly what I was looking for. I love all of their designs, couldn't decide which to choose first. I went with the coastal orange jersey with no regret. At 6ft 165 lbs, the medium fits like a glove. The material is the softest of any jersey I have ever owned. The waist band fits snug so that when the pockets are filled everything stays in place and don't flop around when riding over bumps. The first day I wore it I received several compliments on the jersey. I'm definitely a brand fan for life.

FYI: The Navy Line, isn't actually white. It has a slight blue hue; threw me off at first, but I kinda like it

TIP/SUGGESTION: The fabric is so fine & soft, it can actually get caught in the zipper slightly. I didn't experience it when sipping up while wearing the jersey, since the fabric was stretched. But when zipping up before laundering, it was pretty difficult because the fabric kept getting caught.

A few months after Christmas he texted me thanking me again for this pullover. He said he loves it and wears it all the time. His birthday is coming up and I will be ordering from ORNOT again. Only this time I will get him a gift card. You have some bike shorts I think he would love but do not know what size. That's why the gift card.

Only downside is it's not the most flattering cut (at least for me). Gives off more of an athleisure / dad *** vibe than I thought it would, which prevents it from being the off-bike staple I had hoped. Wish it were a little slimmer around the tummy and waist—there's a bit of excess fabric there.

It's very warm, soft feeling, comfy and the large size fits me surprisingly well on my 6' 4"" slim-muscular build. My shirt sleeves in a fitted shirt usually measure 35.5, so not the longest arms around, but not short. So far the inner material hasn't piled noticeably. Mud/rod grime stains seem to come off easily. 

I (enjoy the cold and) have worn it as a top layer under a vest down to the high 30s (dry) last fall on a social ride. With a wool base layer, it held heat well in that setting. Otherwise, I wear it on and off the bikes. It gets lots of compliments around town for the great golden yellow color and smart fit.

It’s halfway between a sweater and a sweatshirt because the fabric is cozy with a fleece interior while the fit and appearance is more like a nice wool sweater. It is extremely warm and seems to be windproof to some extent such that on a day in the high 60’s it is a little too warm to keep on while riding. I anticipate wearing it often once the weather dips down into the 50’s. 
The one issue I’ve had was after washing it the first time with mild detergent in cold water the sweater came out of the washer smelling somewhat like burnt plastic or rubber. Nothing else in the load had the same smell and the smell went away after letting it hang dry but it was a bit off-putting.

I'm 6'2"" and about 200 lbs and have a long torso--I purchased size Large. One of the problems I often have with sweaters is Large fits me *ok* but I find myself wishing they were just a little longer. To be sure, the fit of this pullover is slim but it's plenty long which makes it very comfortable for me. I don't particularly like my clothes to fit loosely, so if you do, I'd recommend going a size up (for width, not for length).

4411,Michael B.,2022-01-08,United States,5.0,Ultra Versatile,"The cut and design details of this Hoody make it a super versatile piece and I'm really glad I got one. Some reviews state the sizing runs small, I'd say that sort of depends on how you plan on using it. For myself, I'm 5'10"" (long torso), 37"" Chest, 30"" waist and 148lbs. I'm actually somewhere in between a Small and XS in Ornot jerseys. The size chart put me square in a Small, but I ordered a Small and an XS just to be sure. The XS fit, but it was quite snug with a long sleeve tee under, but could have worked if I was going to use it solely as a riding layer only. However, I think versatility was in mind in the design of this piece, so I went with a Small. Its perfectly comfy with a t-shirt for lounging and running errands, makes a great mid layer under a denim jacket, and as I found today, still makes a great riding layer. 

The cut is on the slimmer side and I think maybe its a touch shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create a huge pouch when on the bike. This sort of works out really well, so I guess maybe go up a size if you are buying this strictly just for lounging. Otherwise, I'd say stick with the chart. 

Ride: Today I did a chill recovery ride in a pair of bibs, the sleeveless merino base layer, and this pullover. It was 57F, partly cloudy and I was perfectly cosy, but never overheated. The gridded material does a great job of insulating, while also breathing and allowing some fresh air to blow through. You could probably wear it doing intervals....ornot.

The hood fits well under a helmet when needed, and is quite effective at warding off the cold in low 40s F with moderate wind. The pockets are well-placed and useful.

But, it’s tougher than expected, the subjective shear appearance allows much breath ability, while the material gives warmth without being hot. Sure, it’s late November, but it could be coupled with a base layer or nothing and cross a wide range of temperatures. You could easily use it for hiking, trail running, casual daily use or as a mid weight base layer for snowboarding. Super versatile. I rode part trails and road with my mission shorts for a different vibe, but all the function. I’m 5’8” and 157 lbs., lean but wide shoulders. Some of my ornot tops are mediums, some large just to get my shoulders to fit. I ordered large. It’s neither too long in body or arms, and it’s still slim, which I like. Not skin tight, aero fit, but not flapping around at all. I know it’ll be a go-to keeper for rides and trail runs throughout the remainder of fall, winter and spring.

I love the idea of using deadstock fabric to make other products. The details of this hoodie illustrate the commitment and forethought of the folks at Ornot: wide hem on the cuffs and bottom, zippers on the kangaroo pocket, hidden back pocket, and an extremely light and breathable fabric. 

If you are familiar with Melanzana grid fleeces, the Ornot hoodie is much more breathable. The fabric isn't as soft as a Mele (maybe after washing?), but I think it is more versatile and useable across a range of temperatures. 

As much as I wanted to make this hoodie work, I can't. The sizing is too slim. I comfortably wear XL in Ornot's bike products (jerseys, bibs, jackets, trail shirts, and the merino sweater). I ordered a XXL in the hoodie and I can barely get it on. It would be fine to wear on a bike ride, but not as an everyday layer. I was under the impression that the fit was meant to be more casual, but maybe it has something to do with the fabric that is being used. I recommend this product, but I returned mine.

Most of the reviews and descriptions talk about its breathability and how cool it is but I wore it for the first time yesterday on a 70º F fall evening and it was verging on being uncomfortably warm. The fabric felt more like a thin sweater than a performance cycling jersey, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but just wasn't expected.

4516,Geoffrey B.,2023-06-28,United States,5.0,Love these bibs!,"I own a few pieces of cold weather gear from Ornot but I live and ride in the desert and these bibs are perfect- with lightweight, breathable back and suspenders, and with the option of colors other than black, I stay as cool as possible. The grippers work and the shammy sham sham is the perfect thickness. It’s obvious that these bibs (and all Ornot gear) are designed and built by actual riders. 
Add to that a chill aesthetic from a conscious company who’s actually trying to make a difference? Sold. I will definitely buy more of these bibs to keep in the rotation.

Super chamois that is properly situated. Great bib color. I was amazed at how light and soft they feel. I do have big legs and over time and many rides the elastic in the legs have tired a bit. I chalk that up to big legs, wear and tear, yet I still wear them. Plus, from the get go they never binded my legs as others have, so no complaint, just informing.

4696,CAROL B.,2021-10-13,United States,5.0,It’s all in the design,I purchased the bibs for my husband for the 320 mile OTET. He wore them on day 3 after a 95 mile ride the day before that left him saddle weary. Initially he was skeptical b/c of the low profile padding but the design is so strategic he wished he had worn them from day one of the trip.

4702,William B.,2021-10-13,United States,5.0,House Bib Short,Highly recommend these bib shorts. They have had steady use for 6 months and held up well. Three hour rides outside and on the trainer with no issues. I am 5’11” 147 and bought the small. The fit is supportive not too tight. The chamois is on the thinner side which I prefer.

4739,Michael B.,2021-09-03,United States,5.0,Now a Favorite!,"I own and have owned a lot of different premium bib shorts and I think these strike the best balance of features and price. Great compression (though ordered a size down...more later), killer color (photos don't really do them justice), and most importantly a great pad/chamois. To me a good chamois is a make it or break it deal. These are definitely a make it. 

The Elastic Interface pad strikes a real Goldie Locks balance. Supportive, but not too thick (can't stand a thick chamois), and just the right density for a few hours of riding. I'm also not a big fan of super dense pads...they tend to make me feel numb after a while. So bravo Ornot on pad selection. 

Size: I'm sort of on the cusp of an XS and Small...leaning towards Small. I'm 5'10"" (all torso), 145lbs, 30"" waist, and have fairly lean climber-ish thighs. I prefer a racier cut/fit. I originally ordered a Small but felt like I might swimming around in the crotch a bit...no bueno. So after a little guidance from customer service, I got them swapped for an XS and am super happy with the fit. Hope that maybe helps someone else. 

Overall, I'd give these two thumbs up on price, fit and comfort. I grab these bibs more often than any of my others now.

 I now have 4 Ornot items (an older lightweight Long sleeve jersey, which is an inch too short for my very long arms,and a vest) and will have a fifth when the Stone Vest is again available in Large.

The Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color, good but not superb fit, let down just a tad by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. 
Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (may be due to my height and needing a Medium) Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are better

Also:
- the House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic fit, finish and look, with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length).",,house bib shorts - mesa,Large,,2021,Bibs/Tights,large

The fabric can bunch up in the groin, but pulling down on the legs solves the problem quickly and for a decent amount of time. The chamois is on the thinner/denser side, which is my preference, but don't buy this product if you want a noticeable cushion.

4911,David G.,2021-03-01,United States,5.0,"Excellent fit, durable","Goes without saying the lack of lettering and logos is good. Bought 4 of these a couple of years ago, and I conservatively estimate I put about 100 hours in each pair. Happy to report they're still in good shape -- not a single stich has come loose or undone, unlike a few Italian name brand bibs I've used. Initial feel was stiff, and while they're still holding their shape, they've softened up some. The fabric is showing no obvious signs of wear, though it might be thinning after so many uses and washes. About a year ago I noticed two of the bibs had a tiny amount of the chamois coming through the stitching; I was afraid it was the beginning of an unraveling, but it hasn't gotten worse and I've ignored it. I've worn knee warmers in the winters, and the leg grippers have not loosened from the extra width underneath. I was worried about how much money I was risking on shorts that might not hold up, but they've exceeded my expectations.",,house bib shorts - black,,,2021,Bibs/Tights,No size provided by reviewer

These are cut long enough and the silicone grippers are snug enough that they stay in the right spot, a couple inches above the knee.

4929,Daniel H.,2021-02-02,United States,4.0,Great Value,"The House Bib Shorts exhibit a great value for the cost. Compared to my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts ($229 Retail), the House bib's pad isn't quite as comfortable, but IT IS much more comfortable than the cheaper bibs I own and very comparable to other expensive bibs such as the Giordana FR-C bibshorts ($250 Retail). I also found the compression to be similar to the more expensive Giordana Bib Shorts. One place I feel like these bibs could really improve is in the straps. They're not bad by any means, but they're also nothing special. The straps are similar to much cheaper bibs I own and compared to the straps on my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts, they're definitely a step down. The straps on my Velocio bibs just feel much more comfortable and luxurious. As for size, these bibs are spot on. I often border on the line between Medium and Large, and upon reaching out to customer service, they advised me to order the Medium. They are compressive, but not too tight, and overall fit great. For reference, I am 5'7""-5'8"" and 170ish lbs. I decided to give these 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like there's room for improvement, but they are a great value.

4946,Kyle,2021-01-09,United States,5.0,Color is slightly different than website photos.,"Just got my bibs in the mail and love the fit and quality of them. My only issue is the color being a much lighter grey than I expected. I would say they are more of a medium grey while they look nearly black on my Macbook's display. I understand that displays are very different in their color profiles so I won't dock ORNOT on that in the slightest. What I didn't expect were the white bib straps. Not a huge deal but many bibs color match the straps. I understand that it is more cost-effective to have one set of straps for all of the bibs they produce. In hindsight looking at all of the other house bibs the straps are white but it wasn't shown in any photos on this listing as the one photo is could have the wearer has his arms crossed covering the straps. 

Please update the photos on the slate house bibs to include the bib shoulder straps. This would also highlight the very breathable mesh on the bibs that is very comfortable. I also think one photo with all three color options stacked/fanned out would help show the colors better. Referred to the company by The Gravel Ride Podcast.

LOVES:
- Fit is perfect: gently hugs in all the fight places
-nice Large leg grippers
-Very light weight

LIKES:
-The chamois is pretty thin compared to other brands. This may be preferable to some, but I'm guessing it was chosen to keep the price down. 
-The color doesn't really come though on the website pics. It is more grey than I expected. It is almost a dusty grey. like a tan-grey. ",,house bib short - slate,Small,,2020,Bibs/Tights,small

Fabric is more robust for high humid temps, but these are a workhorse pair of bids for all other days. EIT makes some of the best pads and this is a mid level pad, but still plenty comfy. Seems pretty good for up to 5 hr rides maybe slightly more, but I like thicker pads. Max so far has been a more than a few 4 hrs and still solid. Highly recommend these bibs for everyday use.

5056,Christian M.,2020-08-19,United States,5.0,"Great bibs, great repair service too!","My introduction to Ornot came two years ago when a friend gave me an already well used jersey and pair of house bib shorts. I loved them right away, and started reaching for them earlier and earlier in the clean/dirty, ridden/unridden laundry cycle until they were clear favorites, in particular the bibs. I sized up to a medium from small for this purchase (5’10”, 155lbs,) and they’re very comfortable. At my size and stature both small and mediums work, it’s just a question of how much compression I want on any given day. For this one I went medium because at the age of 42, I’m unlikely to be shedding any more weight... Anyway, I tested them on one short evening ride, and then wore them for a 160 mile, 13k’ day-long ride with nary a bit of discomfort. They’re great bibs.

Regarding Ornot service: I bought a Magic Shell jacket that I also love, but some stitching began to show premature wear. I sent an email, and got a return label right away. The repair was completed and the jacket returned to me within a matter of four or five days. I can’t ask for more than that! ",,house bib shorts - black,Medium,,2020,Bibs/Tights,medium

Not my only bibs but the one I reach for the most for all types of rides in cool to hot temps.

5190,Andi,2020-06-10,,5.0,"Excellent overall, one little ******","I am always unsure about sizing for kit. What the guides don't tell you is, for your measurements, just how tight/compressive or stretchy the article is supposed to fit/feel. I find Rapha and Assos bib shorts to be made of a more stretchy material (and even then I size up from M to L). My Castelli bibs are less-stretchy, so the fit for my size feels tighter. As it turns out, these Ornot bibs are on the compressive/tight side. By that I mean the material doesn't stretch as far. So it's a tad harder to pull these on. Once they are on, they feel really good. Not binding, not tight. 

I'm 5'9"", 158lbs,;I ordered Medium (with some trepidation), but I'm glad I didn't size up. These fit spot-on, and there's no odd looseness or flaring around the leg openings.
The one ****** is that there's a little excess bulk at the front of the pad, so when riding out of the saddle I can feel that bulk at the front shifting side to side (my inner thigh that's at the top of the pedal stroke pushes the pad away, and then my other inner thigh comes up and pushes the pad back the other way). >--hope that makes sense! 

I love Ornot's color palette. Was looking for navy shorts but this Stone Blue is unique and looks great!",,house bib shorts - stone blue,Medium,,2020,Bibs/Tights,medium

The fit is great, especially around the legs where some elastic bands are awkward, the quality is high and the breathability is perfect. The Chamois is all I need for regular 50-100mile rides.

You could save some money and buy an inferior product, ornot.

I don't usually write reviews for contact point items because I think comfort/discomfort comes down to a decent bike fit but these bibs will treat you well if you're pretty comfortable on the bike otherwise. The pad has a lower profile and is more firm than some of the thicker, more plush pads on some of my pricier bibs but I'm satisfied with my experience, especially for the price.

These are the same quality of pro level bibs and the chamois is excellent.

I'm a 31 waste and bought a small, they've definitely got a compressed fit and I almost thought there was no way I'd fit in them but once you pull them up they're perfect.
Chamois is comfortable where they need to be without a huge pad squashing your nuts (not sure why any shorts need to have that and so glad these don't)

5542,David G.,2019-03-13,United States,4.0,Potentially rad,"My ultimate basis for judging bibs is longevity: of the seams, the chamois, and especially the fabric. So a couple of hundred miles isn't nearly enough to judge longevity, and given that I bought enough to rotate them each for a ride a week, I hope that I get a couple of years out of them (about 100 rides). 

That said, the fabric is promising. It seems very sturdy, and feels different from the very stretchy feel of the Castellis and Giordanas I've been using and haven't gotten enough life out of. No issues at all with comfort after several hours in the saddle.

Couple of criticisms: the inseam is somewhat short. Maybe I'm dating myself here, but I much prefer the classic fit of bibs, where the gripper would reach a couple of inches from the knee. Nowadays it seems the typical fit is nearly halfway up the thigh, and the House bibs, while not that bad, could be longer. Also, the cut in the front is high, and combined with the stiff construction, makes peeing a challenge; maybe that will loosen up in time.",,house bib shorts - black,,,2019,Bibs/Tights,No size provided by reviewer

I kept looking to get a summer weight version, but the online store always seemed to be sold out. I finally got a pair this month, and I can attest that the new ones are just as kind to my underparts as the old ones are. Your green pad rules! That combined with great customer service has made me an Ornot fan for life. The handlebar bag is perfect for the long rides. And your socks... Let’s just say they attract a lot of attention.

But we'll see, I've only had it out on a couple rides so far and it still stuffs easily in a jersey pocket. Fits nicely over the house jersey or a thicker base layer.

5743,Richard,2021-10-20,United States,5.0,"Great, but had to exchange for larger size","This is my first cycling vest and my first item purchased from Ornot. Its now a regular piece of my cycling gear for the 50-60°F days. We haven’t gotten below 50°F yet, but I think it’ll do well with layers underneath. I like the bottom zipper, which opens the vest without having to remove it after you’re warmed up. The color matches the photos online. My one complaint about color is that it may clash with my existing jersey colors, but I’m very particular. Currently, I have a white short sleeve that matches nicely. My other jersey color doesn’t match as well. So, I’m thinking of getting the Ornot long sleeve for better color coordination. But that’s all my opinion. The vest is easy to wash, drys quick enough to be used for the next days ride. If you’re not very sweaty, it might be able to be used a couple times without washing). 

In regards to the sizing, it can be tough to purchase clothing online. Again, this was my first Ornot purchase, so I used the sizing chart. 38” chest, 155lb, 5’8”. The chart indicated I’d fit in a Small. Unfortunately, Small was way way too tight in the front. The back fabric is very stretchy, so the back seemed totally fine. But the front is not not stretchy. It was hard to zip up and I couldn’t zip it all the way up my neck. I thought it might be just how it was supposed to fit, and I prefer a smaller/aero fit. But, I separately ordered a Medium to try it out. The Medium fit much better! I was able to zip the medium all the way up my neck, and it still fits snugly, not baggy at all, which is what I was afraid of going with a larger size. Sending back the Small was an easy process. 

All in all, I’ll be ordering from Ornot again. Next order will be jersey. Because I like their business philosophy (made in USA, sustainable practices), simple designs/colors, and my first experience was great.",,house wind vest - stone blue,Medium,,2021,Jackets/Vests,medium

I'm 6'2"" and around 172lbs and wear a medium in all of my other cycling kit. Surprisingly, this jersey is a tad tight in a size medium.

I have returned this medium vest (keeping two other items from Ornot given to me on my birthday by my wife). and will re-order it when they have a Large in stock again. 
It was significantly smaller than my other Medium vest from Ornot (almost 4 years old). 
I'm virtually certain that will be excellent given the construction, appearance, price, etc., hence the 5 stars.

BTW: 
- he House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length).
- the Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color let down just a tad by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (may be due to my height and needing a Medium) Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are better",,house wind vest - stone blue,Medium,,2021,Jackets/Vests,medium

Only give it four stars because I think it would be nice to have a pocket option, but the two way zip does make it fairly easy to get to your jersey.

It's been really great for days when the weather changes or starting in the cool morning before it warms up. It is easy to stash when not needed. The zippers are a bit bigger, which are really nice when wearing gloves. The color is fantastic for visibility when on the road. The two way zip allows access to back jersey pockets, but on a long ride (when eating a lot) I'd probably pick something with built-in pockets. I wore this on a 135 mile gravel ride and that was my only complaint (If I had a top tube feed bag I would have been happy). That being said, if it had pockets it wouldn't be so packable. 
In this case, I had planned to use it only in the morning, but it never warmed up the whole day, and I was really grateful I wore it. ",,house wind vest - morocco,Small,,2021,Jackets/Vests,small

5849,KTS,2021-04-09,United States,5.0,"Windproof, breathable, chain-proof too!","I'm 6'1"" (185cm), 170lbs (78kg), bought a size M and it's a nice tight fit. If I wanted a slightly more casual fit and overstuff my jersey pockets, I might consider a size L. The back of the jersey is made of stretchy breathable fabric, so there's a bit of wiggle room with sizing, and you're less prone to wind up wearing something flapping in the wind like a garbage bag. Also, I love the colors and the lack of logos. Two-way zipper is a big bonus. Also, it wouldn't make sense to put pockets on the back of the vest because that's where the fabric is stretchy and it would just sag.

At first, I was having a hard time justifying the price I paid for this wind vest, but then I had an unfortunate experience. I was wearing a cheaper (not Ornot) jersey, and the loose pockets allowed my stowed wind vest to pop out while I was jamming up a hill and fall directly into my crankset. The vest got stuck in the chainwheel, and also in the rear derailleur cage and brought my pedaling to a halt. After I extracted the vest from my drivetrain and cleaned (most of) the grease off of it at home, I was absolutely shocked to find that the vest had zero holes, rips, or visible damage on it despite being jammed into my drivetrain. So, five stars it is; to me the price is worth it.",,house wind vest - stone blue,Medium,,2021,Jackets/Vests,medium

This L fits me like a non-bicycling S, and I don't like to imagine the Medium. I know that cyclists tend to like things small, but this was REALLY small.

5870,Terence,2021-03-09,United States,4.0,"Lightweight and perfect for cool, but not cold rides.","This vest has become one of my go-to pieces of kit on any early morning ride in the Southern California area I'm in. It's warm enough for rides in the low 50s to 60s (F) and light enough to keep on even as temps rise (for visibility with the orange color) and small enough to roll into a jersey pocket if it gets hot. I'm 6ft tall and have a 40in. measured chest with an average build and the size L is ""race fit"" for my body. One area I think Ornot could improve this vest is to add a silicone gripper to the bottom hem and to make the vest longer in the back by an inch or two. If I have stuff in my jersey pockets (phone, wallet, gels, etc) the vest struggles to stay down over the now filled pockets and begins to slide up just to the top of the pockets. I'm constantly in a battle of tugging the vest down while riding and the vest probably doesn't look that good in that position. If you notice, all the marketing photos show the vest is unzipped on the bottom - well that's how I have to ride just so it keep rolling up over my jersey pockets. I've ended up having to put a top tube bag on my bike and store my stuff in there to keep the jersey pockets empty and in the grand scheme of things, it's a bit silly when silicone grippers could just be added to the garment.",,house wind vest - coastal orange (medium),Large,,2021,Jackets/Vests,large

The breathable back panel means you don't need to take it off on climbs - just unzipping it is fine.
I love the double zip and the fact that the zipper is beefy enough to use with gloves. 

Don't sweat the fact that it doesn't have pockets - your jersey already has plenty. And no pockets helps the vest fold down even smaller.

The other pleasant surprise was how valuable the dual action zipper is; not only does the lower zipper allow you to access your jersey pockets much easier, you can fine tune the warmth of the vest by making little adjustments to how far open the lower zipper is... in my first couple rides with it, I kept thinking this is like adjusting the AC in my car 1 or 2 degrees at a time.",,house wind vest - stone blue,,,2020,Jackets/Vests,No size provided by reviewer

It is a snug fit so keeps me honest with my diet (not a bad thing).

The only issue I have is the depth of the pockets. As an example, my phone doesn't sit completely inside the pocket and about 15% of it pokes out the top. As a result I worry about it falling out quite a lot when I'm riding. 

I wear an XS so I am familiar with having smaller pockets. I appreciate that if they're a bit higher they're harder to get into however I'd much rather than scenario than have to worry about the content of the pockets all the time when I ride.

The House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length). It fits closely but not tightly on me and has very little ""zipper bunch"" when on the bike in the drops or hoods. It might be a tad bit better with a fourth zippered pocket for valuables but not necessary and I knew this when I asked for it, among other Ornot items, for my birthday

BTW:
- the Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color let down somewhat by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (this may be due to my height and needing a Medium but no other bib I have is as difficult )) 
Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are just better but don't have that color!",3.0,house jersey - sage,Large,"6'3"" 168lbs",2021,Jerseys,large

This is a great summer-weight jersey, and the colors along with subtle texture and design cues really help it stand out from a lot of other jerseys, without relying on neon logos or ostentatious patterns. Front of the jersey is a tighter-weave material than the perforated side and back panels, so the jersey does a great job of shedding heat.

Fit is tight - this is more of a race-cut jersey. Don't expect to wear it with out bibs, otherwise your navel might be hanging out. That being said, you don't have to size up like many European brands.

Functionally, my only complaints are that it would be nice to have one small zippered pocket, and at this price point it would be nice to see laser-cut seams on the sleeves with silicone grippers, as opposed to the rolled-and-sewn construction.

Even though it stretches it does keep its firmness on your body and keeps things correctly in the pockets without stretching downward during the ride. I love this jersey along with the maroon one I bought and the long sleeve lead jersey. The cooling effect is great during he ride. Love them all. Will definitely look at the Ornot line in the future.

Regardless, the quality was really high, love the color and the feel of the material. The sleeve length was perfect. Perforation on the back and sides awesome.

I also have to mention how amazing your customer service is, the email communication transparent like no other. I love supporting small companies with the right values!

Fit build, but not like the models on this site. I first tried the medium as everybody else in the comments who matched my body type said that was the right size. It definitely fit my arms/shoulders (which are broad) but it was just a little too high on my waist. It didn't show my belly, but it just looked like it shrunk in the front. (my wife immediately noticed and thought it looked funny) I ordered the Large and it's about an inch or two longer and fits great. It's still snug on my arms, chest, and stomach, but has the length I was looking for. The House Jersey is tight no matter what size you buy, so neither the M or the L were saggy or loose for me. If anything, the M was like sausage-casing racing tightness, the L was a comfortable tightness, surprisingly with no bunching or extra wrinkles. I went through the same process with the bibs but ended up keeping the Mediums.

I would also like to see a top stitch along both sides of the zip, as the zipper gets caught in the jersey from time to time. A zipper garage would also be nice.

The House jersey is just the thing--a perfect fit in an XL--and it breaths well while offering a tad of wind protection. No sags or blowing fabric here. I also own a Preal ozumi jersey which is a distinct cut below the Ornot since it is not lined and has no grippers in the sleeves. But I got the PO jersey because it is bright red and therefore makes me a bit more visible to the giant truck drivers on the streets leading to the gravel tracks.

I own A LOT of kit; Pedla, Pas Normal, Hunter Bros, Attaquer, Pedal Mafia, Rapha, ENDO Customs, SAS and more...no, seriously, even more - Finch, La Passione, Isadore, God&Famous, Ostroy, MONO, Morvelo...and more. I can honestly say (and this is field tested, multi-brand Owner talking here) ORNOT'S FIT AND FINISH IS UNPARALLELED. IT IS PERFECT, IT IS UNMATCHED AND THE PRICING IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BRAND. And the low key graphics - once considered an alternative to the endlessly ""loud"" offerings which exists, has become the new industry pursuit and now other Brands are chasing ORNOT's minimalist aesthetic which they simply cannot do. Sure, PNS has some cool, low volume graphics based on Skando-design elements BUT THAT AINT NEW and frankly at almost $300 for a F*** PNS Jersey for instance is absolutely ******!

FYI: The Navy Line, isn't actually white. It has a slight blue hue; threw me off at first, but I kinda like it

TIP/SUGGESTION: The fabric is so fine & soft, it can actually get caught in the zipper slightly. I didn't experience it when sipping up while wearing the jersey, since the fabric was stretched. But when zipping up before laundering, it was pretty difficult because the fabric kept getting caught.

7308,Henry,2022-10-25,United States,5.0,BUY IT,"I'm rarely compelled to write reviews - but have so enjoyed my time over the past year and a half with this sweatshirt that I feel compelled to share my experiences.

For context, I am 6'6"", with a true inseam of about 38 in (I wear an XL in rpha t shirts, for reference) and somewhere around 200 pounds depending on my mozzarella intake. I bought the XL.

I've worn this sweater mountain biking, not mountain biking, traveling, gravel griding, Citibiking, walking, hiking, on a boat, on rollercoasters, and in the club. It's been flawless every time. It keeps me at just the right temperature - never more, never less, no matter what I am doing. I would say the range of the garment (with a tech t underneath) in my experience, is ~45 to ~70 degrees - which covers all the riding I do save for proper summer days. Under a wind shell its fantastic for cold riding though I don't do much of that. And I'm finding in places where it's cold in the morning but warms up mid day, it's essential for making sure I don't start off my ride chilled.

Fit is perfect for me. I also got the heavier version of this in XXL - knowing I would wear it primarily off bike. XL fit for my body type is perfect for cycling.

This is going into my every day rotation. 

I ordered this based on a recent podcast discussing the environmental impact of the clothing industry. The Ornot folks sounded sincere and genuine.

The small pocket is also nice as well and is surely a touch of style your fellow cyclists will notice (and as my wife pointed out it's a great place to stash my COVID-19 mask - LOL). I tried the S and XS and went with the XS, as I think they run a touch big or at least I preferred a closer fit.

Second, I find the neck a little high when fully zipped; unzipping slightly fixes this obviously but I wish it was a little lower. Third, the material is nice but isn’t the softest next to skin.

I have a few jerseys that I like, but none as well as this. Yes, it's ""tight"" in some places (midsection) but that is my fault and not the fault of this jersey. If I were in better shape, it would feel even better. Fits through the shoulders and chest. have about a 42.5"" chest and about a 35-36"" waist. I also feel ""14% less like a superhero"" all day. I am going to have to order another one of these at some point. Yes, they are a little expensive, but almost all bike jerseys get close to $100, at least at full price. Especially any that are very nice.

7721,Raymond C.,2020-08-11,United States,5.0,Nice jersey; fit not quite right on me,"I'm a fan. The jersey is very well made here in the US, and I think it's priced fairly. Ornot's customer service is excellent. I got responses to questions & order tweaks very quickly, and the return process when I decided not to keep the jersey was very easy. Though this item didn't work out for me, I will definitely be back looking for things from Ornot whenever I shop for bike clothes.

Fit was the issue for me. I'm 6'1"" and about 173 pounds. The medium Work jersey was too tight, especially under the arms, and the large had a little too much extra room for my comfort. It felt nice, but I like a more snug fit than it provided so that I'm not distracted by any jersey flapping on the downhills. Basically, I'm sort of stuck between sizes, I guess. I will try a large House jersey sometime because I think with it's more snug cut, a large will be just about perfect.

I left at sunrise when it was maybe 55F.
Temperatures during the ride went down to 41F and on my way back the numbers climbed back to 82F.
The whole ride I was really comfortable. Had to unzip my jersey as the heat was getting to me at the end but honestly, I can't think of one piece of garment with such a big range of temps.

I often have problems with warmers falling down on my legs below my bib leg grippers - not an issue here as they go up nice and high. As well, the trick is to pull up the ankle area once you get them on so the ankle isn't pulling down on the legging, if you know what I mean. These are perfectly cut and do not bunch up behind your knee. And they are also not too tight on the knee - an issue I have had with other brands/materials. I think the magic here is the length of these, how stretchy they are, and how they are knit to match a bending leg. Really delighted by this purchase! I was on the fence for weeks over whether to buy these and once I did my 1st ride in them just thought I was a ***** for waiting as long as I did! I would 100% recommend these - they are AMAZING!

During my second or third ride I could feel them sliding down, and i was still warming up. 
If i put them early in the morning and i'm just walking around the house, they will slide down before i even start my ride. 
Now i make sure to wear them with a newer pair of bibs, to help keep the leggings in place, but i still need to re-adjust during the ride.

I bought a medium, and it’s great to wear with a pair of bibs. The fit is on the shorter length and pretty darn snug. It’s a little small for day to day wear, but I still rock it with the appropriate shorts or pants. It’s not particularly light feeling, but it does feel like the weight is well distributed (some shirts feel like they are pulling themselves down because the weight sits at the bottom of the shirt). It feels durable, I’m pretty sure it could survive a fall or two. If I get more for casual wear I’ll try a large, based on the cut it this it shouldn’t be too boxy. My only really strange experience with this shirt is just how small the neck is and the fact that it has almost no give. I have a medium sized head, and it’s a struggle to get it through the neck of the shirt. I have never experienced this before. At times, this can feel restricting, just knowing this is so dang tight. And I grab it and try to stretch it out, and there’s no give. If you have a big head you are gonna have a moment or two when you put these shirts on.

The bag fits nicely angled a bit under the bars or right out in front. I've only used this on drop bar bikes, but it seems like it would work on any bike.

The straps, however are extremely bulky given the small size of the bag. I would have preferred an option to remove the velcro straps and use small voile straps, or similar.

Thanks to the frame sheet between the fabric layers it holds its shape beautifully even when filled. I have kept snacks, iPhone 12pro, multi-tool, pocket pump and there is still a bit of room! 
It is secure! The Velcro straps with the addition of the tether cord practically eliminates movement.

8511,LesKWpg,2022-01-25,Canada,5.0,Outstanding handlebar bag!,"Very happy with my purchase. Even with the Canadian currency exchange and shipping, this little 'mini' handlebar bag from Ornot is WELL WORTH the price when compared to what's available from the usual manufacturers at the local shops. Fits a Samsung Galaxy A8, a standard wallet, Bose Bluetooth earbuds in their soft case, and a key fob garage door opener with plenty of room to comfortably get at each item, so anyone with these very large smart phones should be good to go...(lol, I don't normally carry all that around, just giving an example of the capacity!).

The bag looks very nice when installed, perfect size, not too large or obtrusive. Mounted it on an entry level 'hybrid' bike so the cables aren't as tidy as in the website pics, but the brake and shifter cables aren't a problem as the location of the zipper makes it quite easy to get at the contents.
Very well made...the materials and quality of manufacture are outstanding...short of it going 'missing'... pretty sure it'll last for years to come! Going to be ordering a couple more of these for some other people that I know will want one as soon as they see mine! :)

The reflective strip of webbing across the front is key for attaching a light or some extra swag with a pin or two, and the front zipper seems to be positioned in a perfect spot for easy access (often overlooked with handlebar bags). 

Unfortunately, I had to knock a star for two reasons. The stiff insert that gives the bag its shape has also proven to be a hinderance in getting the bag mounted correctly on my cockpit. Because of the way my computer mount on my integrated bars is positioned, I am un-able to get the bag mounted flush under the bars. Coupled with the fixed (stitched in place) velcro straps, I'm unable to get this bag to work with my road bike setup and it was a bit askew and awkward on my gravel bikes cockpit. Granted, this wont be an issue for everyone...just keep in mind if you have any under bar computer mounts.

These gloves are warm but don't become overly hot and hands don't get clammy like in gloves made with synthetic materials. The grip is very nice too. I use mine A LOT, so they do wear out, but they are good quality and value. I use mine to -5°C (that's 23°F), but I'm pushing the minimum temperature.

But I would think that 36-38 would be absolute max based on remaining fabric. Only downside I will comment on is because this belt basically has 2 ends (meaning there's connectors on both vs basic nylon on one), it is not so easy to 'pull through' the belt. I constantly move from pants to pants to shorts to pants and its been a learning curve to not just yank it through. There's definitely a preferred way it likes to go, but still not silky.

9627,Charles J.,2022-10-16,United States,5.0,"The best casual cycling shorts I've tried, even with a few nits.","After eyeing up the Mission Shorts for awhile, I finally went to hit ""Purchase"", only to be pleasantly surprised that Ornot had just released the Lightweight version! I was actually a bit reluctant to order the original version, as other friends and reviews had mentioned that the material can be a bit thick and the shorts can get hot, so it was perfect timing.

After wearing them for a few weeks, I am very, very, very happy with these shorts. I am normally a swrve guy, having owned multiple pairs of pants, trousers, knickers, and most recently, their Transverse lightweight shorts. I really love swrve stuff, but their sizing and cuts can be a bit inconsistent, leading to some low waists, high crotches, and tight thighs. Plus, I was really excited to find that Ornot's stuff is still being made in the US!

Compared to the best-fitting stuff I have from swrve, which fits me pretty well, these Lightweight Mission Shorts fit me *perfectly*, and are even more lightweight. I usually am a 30"" in virtually all other brands, and also took a tape measure to myself and other pairs of shorts. I found the slightly generous ""16in for a 30"" waist"" sizing and cut to be very comfortable, allowing me to wear them slightly above the hips for a 'normal-rise' fit without causing any crotch tightness or discomfort. The material is surprisingly lightweight. The thighs are very comfortable and leave good room for me without looking baggy at all. For real, you don't realize how poorly other shorts fit you until you put a pair of these on.

Things I love:
- The high waisted cut.
- The flat edge of the pocket is along the outside of the thigh, so that things feel very secure (as opposed to the flat edge being along the front of the thigh).
- I really appreciate the reinforced belt loop for keys.
- The slash pockets as opposed to jean-style pockets.

Minor nits:
- The 8.5"" inseam is noticeably shorter for me than the 9"" on my swrve. Be prepared to show some leg while pedaling!
- The front pockets could use a bit more finishing. There is only one stitch at the seam of the pocket, but while riding, the inside material of the pocket tends to want to flip and bunch outwards, creating a kind of awkward billow. It's very subtle, but enough to bother me.
- No reflectivity. Give me some reflective belt loops like swrve! Or even a subtle thing like a reflective Ornot tag along one of the legs instead of the non-reflective logo tag.
- I'm not crazy about the angled back pockets. They seem to knock something that would have otherwise passed as 'normal' clothing into an 'athletic-y, not-so-casual' item.
- On my swrve shorts, the zip pocket is the rear left, and the rear right is open. I like this configuration because I put my wallet in the left and tuck keys into the right. On these Ornot shorts, the open side is left and the zipper is right, leading to an unsecured wallet and over-secured/hard to access keys. I recognize this is a personal thing, but wish it either matched my swrve shorts or were both just zippered.

All the above being said, these shorts are a 4.75 out of 5 for me. These shorts very quickly kicked out my swrve Transverse as my daily-driver short. I just wish I could afford more pairs in more colors! I'll also now consider getting a pair of the regular-weight shorts for the transition seasons. Really great purchase overall.",,lightweight mission short - slate,30,,2022,Shorts/Pants,30

I’m 5’8” and 156 lbs. and medium/32 waist fits me perfectly. My last 3 pair, are consistent in size. But, my first ran a little bigger, but work great with a padded undershort for long rides.

The fit is similar and the material is decidedly thinner. I haven't had a chance to wear these anywhere hot yet, so I can't say how they compare for that, probably making this review useless overall. The biggest con so far is that the material is kind of a ""hard"" swishy tech fabric, so the pants are kind of loud.

And yes - the chamois sort of sticks out a little in the back when you’re off the bike. But so do other $300+ bibs from other brands. I care about what it does on the bike; not when I’m standing around. 

Also yes - the bib straps are kind of thin. I do wish they were thicker. But again - I don’t personally notice it at all once I am riding. They didn’t bother me. 

I really like material overall. It’s thin in a good way and feels very light and comfortable and stretchy on the skin. 

I bought the slate color and like it a lot. It’s very solidly gray and has a little shine on the leg grippers. I really like the slight texture/patterned appearance of the bibs also. 

I am between 6’0 and 6’1 and about 170 lbs. I bought a Large and I will say these fit looser than size Large I have from some other brands. The straps are looser, which is probably a good thing for most people. They don’t pull down your shoulders. I probably could easily go with a medium. If you’re about my size and you like your bibs tighter, I would go medium.

Overall - these look great and I was impressed with how much they disappeared while riding.",,men's house bib short - slate,Large,,2023,Bibs/Tights,large

9885,Michael B.,2021-09-03,United States,5.0,Now a Favorite!,"I own and have owned a lot of different premium bib shorts and I think these strike the best balance of features and price. Great compression (though ordered a size down...more later), killer color (photos don't really do them justice), and most importantly a great pad/chamois. To me a good chamois is a make it or break it deal. These are definitely a make it. 

The Elastic Interface pad strikes a real Goldie Locks balance. Supportive, but not too thick (can't stand a thick chamois), and just the right density for a few hours of riding. I'm also not a big fan of super dense pads...they tend to make me feel numb after a while. So bravo Ornot on pad selection. 

Size: I'm sort of on the cusp of an XS and Small...leaning towards Small. I'm 5'10"" (all torso), 145lbs, 30"" waist, and have fairly lean climber-ish thighs. I prefer a racier cut/fit. I originally ordered a Small but felt like I might swimming around in the crotch a bit...no bueno. So after a little guidance from customer service, I got them swapped for an XS and am super happy with the fit. Hope that maybe helps someone else. 

Overall, I'd give these two thumbs up on price, fit and comfort. I grab these bibs more often than any of my others now.

 I now have 4 Ornot items (an older lightweight Long sleeve jersey, which is an inch too short for my very long arms,and a vest) and will have a fifth when the Stone Vest is again available in Large.

The Mesa House Bibs are a fantastic color, good but not superb fit, let down just a tad by a pad that isn't truly long distance oriented and looks just a bit off due to a slight folding in the crotch when off the bike. 
Also, there isn't much elasticity in the waist for when nature calls (may be due to my height and needing a Medium) Still I like it and am keeping that. My bibs from Velocio and Assos are better

Also:
- the House Jersey in Sage (Lg) is fantastic fit, finish and look, with arms long enough for a tall rangy person (unlike the lightweight long sleeve jersey I have which I like a lot but needs another 1"" of length).",,house bib shorts - mesa,Large,,2021,Bibs/Tights,large

The fabric can bunch up in the groin, but pulling down on the legs solves the problem quickly and for a decent amount of time. The chamois is on the thinner/denser side, which is my preference, but don't buy this product if you want a noticeable cushion. Waist is easy to pull down to use the restroom, but also on the shorter side so my midriff has been exposed on occasion. Great color. Definitely a superior product to my specialized RBX shorts.

Bought 4 of these a couple of years ago, and I conservatively estimate I put about 100 hours in each pair. Happy to report they're still in good shape -- not a single stich has come loose or undone, unlike a few Italian name brand bibs I've used. Initial feel was stiff, and while they're still holding their shape, they've softened up some. The fabric is showing no obvious signs of wear, though it might be thinning after so many uses and washes. About a year ago I noticed two of the bibs had a tiny amount of the chamois coming through the stitching; I was afraid it was the beginning of an unraveling, but it hasn't gotten worse and I've ignored it. I've worn knee warmers in the winters, and the leg grippers have not loosened from the extra width underneath. I was worried about how much money I was risking on shorts that might not hold up, but they've exceeded my expectations.",,house bib shorts - black,,,2021,Bibs/Tights,No size provided by reviewer

10075,Daniel H.,2021-02-02,United States,4.0,Great Value,"The House Bib Shorts exhibit a great value for the cost. Compared to my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts ($229 Retail), the House bib's pad isn't quite as comfortable, but IT IS much more comfortable than the cheaper bibs I own and very comparable to other expensive bibs such as the Giordana FR-C bibshorts ($250 Retail). I also found the compression to be similar to the more expensive Giordana Bib Shorts. One place I feel like these bibs could really improve is in the straps. They're not bad by any means, but they're also nothing special. The straps are similar to much cheaper bibs I own and compared to the straps on my Velocio Signature Bib Shorts, they're definitely a step down. The straps on my Velocio bibs just feel much more comfortable and luxurious. As for size, these bibs are spot on. I often border on the line between Medium and Large, and upon reaching out to customer service, they advised me to order the Medium. They are compressive, but not too tight, and overall fit great. For reference, I am 5'7""-5'8"" and 170ish lbs. I decided to give these 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like there's room for improvement, but they are a great value.

10110,Kyle,2021-01-09,United States,5.0,Color is slightly different than website photos.,"Just got my bibs in the mail and love the fit and quality of them. My only issue is the color being a much lighter grey than I expected. I would say they are more of a medium grey while they look nearly black on my Macbook's display. I understand that displays are very different in their color profiles so I won't dock ORNOT on that in the slightest. What I didn't expect were the white bib straps. Not a huge deal but many bibs color match the straps. I understand that it is more cost-effective to have one set of straps for all of the bibs they produce. In hindsight looking at all of the other house bibs the straps are white but it wasn't shown in any photos on this listing as the one photo is could have the wearer has his arms crossed covering the straps. 

Please update the photos on the slate house bibs to include the bib shoulder straps. This would also highlight the very breathable mesh on the bibs that is very comfortable. I also think one photo with all three color options stacked/fanned out would help show the colors better. Referred to the company by The Gravel Ride Podcast.

Fabric is more robust for high humid temps, but these are a workhorse pair of bids for all other days. EIT makes some of the best pads and this is a mid level pad, but still plenty comfy. Seems pretty good for up to 5 hr rides maybe slightly more, but I like thicker pads. Max so far has been a more than a few 4 hrs and still solid. Highly recommend these bibs for everyday use.

I loved them right away, and started reaching for them earlier and earlier in the clean/dirty, ridden/unridden laundry cycle until they were clear favorites, in particular the bibs. I sized up to a medium from small for this purchase (5’10”, 155lbs,) and they’re very comfortable. At my size and stature both small and mediums work, it’s just a question of how much compression I want on any given day. For this one I went medium because at the age of 42, I’m unlikely to be shedding any more weight... Anyway, I tested them on one short evening ride, and then wore them for a 160 mile, 13k’ day-long ride with nary a bit of discomfort. They’re great bibs.

Regarding Ornot service: I bought a Magic Shell jacket that I also love, but some stitching began to show premature wear. I sent an email, and got a return label right away. The repair was completed and the jacket returned to me within a matter of four or five days. I can’t ask for more than that! ",,house bib shorts - black,Medium,,2020,Bibs/Tights,medium

10354,Andi,2020-06-10,,5.0,"Excellent overall, one little ******","I am always unsure about sizing for kit. What the guides don't tell you is, for your measurements, just how tight/compressive or stretchy the article is supposed to fit/feel. I find Rapha and Assos bib shorts to be made of a more stretchy material (and even then I size up from M to L). My Castelli bibs are less-stretchy, so the fit for my size feels tighter. As it turns out, these Ornot bibs are on the compressive/tight side. By that I mean the material doesn't stretch as far. So it's a tad harder to pull these on. Once they are on, they feel really good. Not binding, not tight. 

I'm 5'9"", 158lbs,;I ordered Medium (with some trepidation), but I'm glad I didn't size up. These fit spot-on, and there's no odd looseness or flaring around the leg openings.
The one ****** is that there's a little excess bulk at the front of the pad, so when riding out of the saddle I can feel that bulk at the front shifting side to side (my inner thigh that's at the top of the pedal stroke pushes the pad away, and then my other inner thigh comes up and pushes the pad back the other way). >--hope that makes sense!

I don't usually write reviews for contact point items because I think comfort/discomfort comes down to a decent bike fit but these bibs will treat you well if you're pretty comfortable on the bike otherwise. The pad has a lower profile and is more firm than some of the thicker, more plush pads on some of my pricier bibs but I'm satisfied with my experience, especially for the price.

These are the same quality of pro level bibs and the chamois is excellent.

I'm a 31 waste and bought a small, they've definitely got a compressed fit and I almost thought there was no way I'd fit in them but once you pull them up they're perfect.
Chamois is comfortable where they need to be without a huge pad squashing your nuts (not sure why any shorts need to have that and so glad these don't)

Will be buying again for sure.",,house bib shorts - black,Small,,2020,Bibs/Tights,small

10715,David G.,2019-03-13,United States,4.0,Potentially rad,"My ultimate basis for judging bibs is longevity: of the seams, the chamois, and especially the fabric. So a couple of hundred miles isn't nearly enough to judge longevity, and given that I bought enough to rotate them each for a ride a week, I hope that I get a couple of years out of them (about 100 rides). 

That said, the fabric is promising. It seems very sturdy, and feels different from the very stretchy feel of the Castellis and Giordanas I've been using and haven't gotten enough life out of. No issues at all with comfort after several hours in the saddle.

Couple of criticisms: the inseam is somewhat short. Maybe I'm dating myself here, but I much prefer the classic fit of bibs, where the gripper would reach a couple of inches from the knee. Nowadays it seems the typical fit is nearly halfway up the thigh, and the House bibs, while not that bad, could be longer. Also, the cut in the front is high, and combined with the stiff construction, makes peeing a challenge; maybe that will loosen up in time.",,house bib shorts - black,,,2019,Bibs/Tights,No size provided by reviewer

I kept looking to get a summer weight version, but the online store always seemed to be sold out. I finally got a pair this month, and I can attest that the new ones are just as kind to my underparts as the old ones are. Your green pad rules! That combined with great customer service has made me an Ornot fan for life. The handlebar bag is perfect for the long rides. And your socks... Let’s just say they attract a lot of attention.

So my first pair was a 34, which was big enough that I need a belt. However, the belt loop material sags a bit with most heavier belts, so it's hard to really get them to cinch. The 32 was actually perfect. So if you're in between like me, size down. The inseam and length is perfect for me. Very flattering on the legs. Not too long or too short. I'm 6', 195 lbs. I would give 5 stars were it not for two issues: the crotch and the pockets. The crotch has a lot of seams going on and can be uncomfortable walking around, especially in the summer when sweating. The pockets are very thin and walking around with a phone, wallet, or keys in them is very uncomfortable. Whatever you have in them will just scratch up against your skin.

My wife calls them my trim-fit ""euro"" shorts (as a compliment). The weight, length, durability and design are pretty much spot-on. My only issue is with the leg opening size. It's about 1/2"" too narrow for bike racer thighs. When I sit down in them, the legs tend to bunch up and get stuck up on my mid-thigh because of it (and maybe the material).

10939,Alexander K.,2022-08-30,United States,5.0,Current favorites from a shorts enthusiast,"I'm very particular about my shorts and constantly on the hunt for the perfect pair -- prefer a shorter inseam, tighter fitting, durable but stretchy without looking like athletic shorts. For hike/bike, I've tried everything from Patagonia, Topo, canvas Bear Bottoms, Crust, Vuori, Swrve, Ripton (current favorite, wish they made chinos). These may have eclipsed Ripton as my favorite outdoor hike, bike shorts. Super clean looking, plenty of stretch, no weird bunching or pinching, light and dry quick, and my biggest pet peeve, they have a normal amount of rise so it doesn't mash your junk. These guys are expensive but off of a few wears, seem like a good value. Will order more and would love to see more color variety.

FWIW, I'm 5' 8"", 155 and typically wear a 28"" to 29"" waist and sometimes 30"" depending on cut. I bought a 28"" in these because of the stretch and I like a tighter fit for biking. Fit great but pockets are pulling a little.",,mission short - olive,28,,2022,Shorts/Pants,28

The 32 are a little snug but the fabric has enough give to fit well. Don’t know that a 33 wouldn’t feel too big all things equal, and would almost for sure need a belt if I went with 34, which I wouldn’t want to wear with these.

I definitely needed a belt for them, but the leg length and width was perfect. I then ordered black and olive in 32"" hoping they would fit a little better. The waist was a better fit for me, not too small, stretchy, however much smaller dimensions otherwise. The legs were shorter and tighter, too tight. I much preferred the leg dimensions of the 34"". I was surprised at the difference but the 34"" fit me so well in the leg that I exchanged the 32""s for 34""s. So I now have in all three colors, but just need to wear with a belt. A navy blue would be nice in these. I will say the pocket material is a very thin mesh, and having items in them is not comfortable while walking. Fine for cycling, but items like phones and keys poke through those pockets. The outer material is great. Just enough stretch and seems sturdy and resilient.

I often have a problem with shorts where they are too tight in the thigh and too loose around the hips which makes the legs awkwardly ride up, but the fit and stretch of these is perfect. They look much smarter than your standard outdoor/hiking shorts, and the material seems sturdy and durable. I exclusively wear bibs for long rides so I can’t speak to how they hold up for “serious” cycling, but off the bike I’ve barely taken them off since I got them, and they’ve been superbly comfortable for quick rides around town. My only (minor) complaint is the lack of a small pocket for keys, change, etc. One of the back pockets is zippered, but it’s full size which means you’re sitting on your keys if you put them there. A smaller pocket within or above the front pockets (like the change pocket on a pair of jeans) or a small zippered pocket on the leg would help a lot.

The shorts have a slim cut but look great and the feedback I’ve gotten is that they suit me well. The mesa color is nice too. The 8” inseam is recommended if you prefer a cut above the knees.

I recently ordered a couple more pairs since they were back in stock and they just weren't the same as the original pairs I own. The leg opening was tighter and made these fit more like tights than shorts and the pocket opening is so small it's difficult to get my hand in /out. I wear a 28 and am average build so it's not that I have abnormally large thighs. After looking at how the shorts fit in the photos on the website (a finger or two of room at the leg opening), I'm starting to think that as you get to the smaller sizes, the proportions are slightly off. I tried a size 30 thinking that maybe I am actually a size larger, but they weren't even close to fitting in the waist. Again, I love these shorts and do plan on trying them again, but would love to see a little looser leg opening on future iterations.

11019,Matt G.,2022-06-21,United States,2.0,Leaning more towards Not,"Was really hoping to love these shorts due to their very strong reviews, seemingly great material and simple cut. Turns out, the fit is very wonky and as a result, they’re not very comfortable to ride in (mostly using them as summer commuting shorts). First, the waist: I’d really love if Ornot would make some changes here, mostly in offering some odd-numbered waist sizes (namely 31). The 32 is rather roomy on me, but I’m sure the 30 would be too snug elsewhere. A belt works ok here, but due to the thin nature of the materials, can cause some bunching. I’d also love to see the addition of a key loop or something (not just belt loops). The rise (or something): Immediately upon putting these shorts on, things start to bunch up in the nethers. I’m not entirely sure what the culprit is, but it’s very annoying. Rise too short? Is the interior fabric too textured and starts bunching up yer undies? Not sure, but whatever it is, it’s uncomfortable. The worst part, the leg openings: Simply put, they’re too small. I get we all want to show off our glistening tree trunks for legs (of which mine actually aren't), but the small leg openings cause these to ride up significantly when riding. I find myself constantly trying to pull them down while on the bike. Couple that with the aforementioned issues of the rise, and you get a pretty uncomfortable ride. Oh, and forget about wearing them in the heat and humidity of the midwest too; all of the above bunching issues just get worse.

The shorts themselves are a really nice quality! They have a slim fit with a low-ish waist. The legs are a bit shorter than I’m used to but that’s ok. They have a comfortable stretch to them and are surprisingly light weight. There aren’t many features really, except for 1 zippered back pocket, but their simplicity is what’s nice about them.

They fit well, are extremely comfortable (especially for someone with larger quads), and seem very durable. The perfect short for rides when you don't want to don your bibs. They're hefty without being stiff or overly heavy.

My only concern is that they're cut a bit shorter than i'm used to so, when I sit down, they ride quite high. But that's just because no one wants to see that much of my legs!

What really sold me, though—and this is true of all the pieces I’ve purchased from Ornot—is that they are made here in California. 

I wouldn’t change a thing… or not.

11282,Jonathon T.,2021-08-10,United States,5.0,Love em- Olive shorts,"Stats: 5'8"" 150-155lbs 
Ideal Pant size: 31x30 but sometimes a 30 waist works and sometimes a 32 works. 
In this case, the 30 waist worked best for me, i also tried on the 32 but there was just a bit too much space for wearing without a belt. a 31 would have been right on the money!! 
Pros: color and material are perfect. Just enough stretch that they loosen up the longer you wear them, which is good for me cause the waist on the 30 reminds me that i need to chill on the pizza and beer. Snug on the thighs but i dig that, i dont have very big thighs and these still hug them, especially when your leg is bent (i.e., top of a pedal stroke) its almost as if youre wearing bibs. Helps keep those tan lines dialed. I would be comfortable wearing these on bike, in the dirt, bushwacking, in the water, at disneyland, to brunch, etc,.
-rear pocket zipper is a great touch
Cons: Some inconsistencies with the size of the front pocket opening. The pair of 32's had a way smaller opening than the 30's. I could barely get my hand through. I understand that this would be good for keeping items from falling out but there was definitely a noticeable difference. 
-Since the inside of the rear pockets are this really nice light mesh material and (I dont think) theyre attached to the short, they tend to get bunched up when pulling items like a wallet out, especially if the shorts are on the tighter side. A little annoying, but not a deal breaker for me. 

All in all, i would definitely recommend these shorts and would buy a pair in every color if they made a 31 waist and were a little cheaper, though i can understand the labor/material cost when manufacturing technical clothing in the USA. I have the vest, magic shell, couple of jerseys, bibs, socks, buttery cotton tees, and now the shorts to add to my Ornot collection.

I am 225lbs on a good day and wear a 36. My thighs, thunderous. My ***, thiccer than a snicker. Raised on corn and buttermilk biscuits, I am not the average size cyclist. And boy is it hard to find shorts that both comfortably fits my lower half and doesn’t have an inseam that makes me look like I’m wearing a pair of JNCO’s from my wildest 90’s fantasy. These solve all of those issues. As soon as I slipped these on I felt as though they were perfectly hugging my legs without being suffocating to my nether regions. Even while sitting, the stretch in these provides a hug more tender than your mother’s love. Soft and caressing, yet firm and supporting. I can’t wait to scoot around town on these for casual pub ride or an exploration day in the gravel saddle. 

Bottom line. Buy them.",,mission short - olive,36,,2021,Shorts/Pants,36

I have worn these shorts for two weeks in a row after buying them in the sage color and then just bought them in the slate color. These are the best shorts I've ever had, especially if you're into the shorter inseam fit. The material has a slight course & durable texture to it. You can tell it won't rip anytime soon. The zippered back pocket is great for small things. I would use it for a passport if traveling, for example. Also, the pockets themselves have this super nice texture to it. It's like a very soft tactile, felt-like material combined with the durability of a rip-stop nylon type material. It's just great. They also stretch just enough.

If these get anymore 5 star reviews, I'll never get a pair in Obsidian (Black)! ;)

Fit: I'm a solid 30 inch waist in just about every pair of pants/short I own. The 30s are spot on...with a tad extra room, but not so much that I need a belt...perfect. Plus, theres enough give in the fabric that even if I did put on a few extra LBS it wouldn't be a big deal. I find the inseam length to be just about perfect for a short that doubles as a casual summer short and commuting to work short. Finally, the Sage color is super classy looking and goes with just about any color t-shirt...total win.

Construction: Top notch. I can tell by the care thats been taken into the materials and construction that these are going to last me a while. I tend find a pair of shorts that I like and then blow through them after about two years from relentless wear and repeated washings. I have a feeling these will last quite a bit longer. The riveted button and zipper are sturdy. Pocket liners are meshy so they breath when on the bike, and the rear right pocket has a zip closure on it (which is a great touch). I also have to say that I'm super stoked to be supporting a company that builds such a quality product right here in my home state of CA. Kudos!

These shorts are perfect for on the bike, kicking it around the house on the weekend, summer BBQs, backyard exploring and everything in between. If I had one bit of input to offer up, I'd say it be really cool if one of the front pockets had a zip closure, like the rear, so that it doesn't feel like my phone is going pop out of my pocket while on the bike running errands. Other than that, don't hesitate to buy a pair!!! 
Now please Ornot....can we get a restock of Obsidian in size 30. :D",,mission short - sage,30,,2021,Shorts/Pants,30

Sizing is accurate and consistent with other brands. 100 bucks for a pair of shorts is hard pill to swallow but well worth it in my opinion. Also seems to be somewhat water/stain resistant. ,,mission short - obsidian,30,,2020,Shorts/Pants,30

11650,Ryan F.,2020-10-06,United States,5.0,Almost Too Sexy,"These shorts are shorter and tighter than I thought they would be. Makes my butt pop and are SUPER stretchy for all the deep squats for picking things off the floor (lift with your legs, not with your back, right?).

The fit does not seem to pair well with cycling bibs. The legs are a bit shorter than most of the legs on my bibs, so when walking, pedaling or bending over, the under layer tends to extend past the shorts.

For sizing, I wear a 31 and sized down fine. The stretch gives it the little extra give to hug my contours. 

The slate is also really nice. I originally had the Sage, but that came out a little more green/gray than green. The slate looks like it does on the website.

the sewing and construction is meticulous. the fabric is spot on, and they are made in the USA and are carbon offset. they are priced perfectly for what they are. I just picked up a second pair in sage because I am fearful they will sell out of this most recent run.

11675,Clint C.,2020-09-30,Hong Kong,4.0,"Very very good, almost great","I have 3 pairs. The first pair was the original slate colour and then I bought the other 2 colours recently.

Fit is perfect. I'm 5'8"" wearing medium. I've donated several other pairs of old favorite shorts (from Uniqlo) as the Mission short is really that great a fit.

However...

The first pair has a belt loop which is losing its threading and about to come undone. However I have rarely worn belts on it, so I find that a bit strange and even if I wore belts all the time I'd expect the loops to hold up better. I have not worn belts with other 2 pairs including this obsidian one. Gives me pause about clipping on keys.

Also on the first pair I got, after several months it's now worn in, and a bit looser around the waist than when I first got them. Not unexpected as that obviously happens with all clothing, but doesn't feel as great as the brand new ones that I have, and I believe due to the stretch fabric, it seems to loosen more than non-stretch shorts.

All-in-all, the best fitting shorts that I've worn. Quality is good, perhaps could be a bit better. Value is suspect at $108 a pair, but I don't think you're making massive margins off these anyway so that's fine.",,mission short - obsidian,30,,2020,Shorts/Pants,30

11686,Samuel A.,2020-09-19,United States,5.0,Mission Shorts,"These shorts are fantastic. I’m a proponent of “fewer nicer things”, and they fit right into that ethos. 

Prior to purchasing these shorts, I had been wearing another Bay Area handmade cycling short. They lasted a solid 5 years, but the amount of pocket sewing and alterations made me look elsewhere for the next everyday wear. 

I originally ordered two pairs of these shorts, a size 30 & 32. I ended up exchanging the 32 for the 30 and couldn’t be happier. For reference, I’m 6’ 172 lbs. The inseam is nice a short, the gusset is wonderful, and they hug my quads comfortably. I prefer a tighter short and these have fit the bill. They are comfortable on the bike and appear to dry quickly. They do come with a DWR, though I’ve found it typically rubs off within a week or two — oh well! As long as they dry quickly, I’m happy 😊

The material is a great mix of durability and soft feel. Fit is perfect for me, which has been hard to find from other brands. The 28 is just right on my waist with a minimally tightened belt and the legs look great on my quads which must be bigger than the average skinny guy because no one else seems to get it right. Commuting 8 miles round trip by bike and on my feet for 8 hours and they’re always comfortable and aren’t disgustingly smelly by the time I’m getting home.

They’re replacing a pair of Cadence Skyline shorts worn for about 4 years straight and I can already tell these will go the distance.

11795,nathan p.,2019-12-01,United States,5.0,Mission Short,"The shorts are ******* rad. The sizing info on the website should just be updated, the shorts are not agressively small and really fit pretty true to size. Even with a more muscular build the fit is pretty much what you would expect. Great product, need more colorways and a pant version.

11801,Jordan S.,2019-11-21,United States,4.0,Solid Everyday Short,"Shorts are well constructed and will be a great choice for everyday wear. 

My only issue was sizing. At 6’1, 175-180lbs I was deciding between 33 & 34. The 33 waist was perfect but slimmer in thighs (the shorts would be perfect if it was a 33 waist with the 34 thighs)",,mission short - slate,,,2019,Shorts/Pants,No size provided by reviewer

11803,ROBERT D.,2019-11-19,United States,5.0,Great Quality and Fit!,"I've been wanting to try these out for a while, however they were out of my size. Luckily when they finally restocked I was able to snag a pair! Since receiving them I have been very impressed by their fit, build quality and versatility. I travel a lot and these have become my go to shorts due to their color and wrinkle resistance if packed in a frame bag. The fit on these is also great for a skinny cyclist with big legs...always tough to find something that fits and pumped that ornot hit the bullseye on these!",,mission short - slate,,,2019,Shorts/Pants,No size provided by reviewer

11812,Patrick C.,2019-10-04,United States,5.0,New Go To!,"In all fairness, I had to exchange my pair for a different size; however, I can already tell that the fit and fabric will work perfectly for ripping on my bike, on my stand up paddle board, and any other outdoor activity, and not leaving me looking like a yutz walking into a cafe or pub afterwards.

Ultralight and comfortable af. I was concerned about them being too slim (and they are; I nearly returned them), but after a couple of days of wearing loosened up. Waiting for these in black.

The only downside: The way the stitching is along the pocket crease causes the pocket interior to try and escape as you move around. It’s not bad, I just have to push the pockets in every once in a while as they start to creep out. Happens on both pair I own.",,mission short - slate,,,2019,Shorts/Pants,No size provided by reviewer

I loved the fabric, the feel, the length & the leg width…but unfortunately, as the entire short fit perfectly-albeit the waist was too large. I won’t be able to size down for the waist to fit, bc in turn the rest of the shorts (the thighs, the length, the crotch) will be way too tight. I want the overall size of the 33, but the waist of the 32. Just not a great fit for my body, unfortunately.",,mission short - slate,,,2019,Shorts/Pants,No size provided by reviewer
